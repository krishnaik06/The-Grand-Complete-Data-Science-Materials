 Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’s Eve Message; This is Disturbing,"Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans a Happy New Year and leave it at that.

 Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

 Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People ‘In The Eye’,"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet. I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me,  the former sheriff tweeted.

 Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name Coded Into His Website (IMAGES),"On Christmas day, Donald Trump announced that he would  be back to work  the following day, but he is golfing for the fourth day in a row. The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.71 rounds of golf including today s. At this pace, he ll pass Obama s first-term total by July 24 next year. https://t.co/Fg7VacxRtJ pic.twitter.com/5gEMcjQTbH  Philip Bump (@pbump) December 29, 2017 That makes what a Washington Post reporter discovered on Trump s website really weird, but everything about this administration is bizarre AF. The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z.

Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites.

 Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech,"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.",News,"December 25, 2017"
 Racist Alabama Cops Brutalize Black Boy While He Is In Handcuffs (GRAPHIC IMAGES),"The number of cases of cops brutalizing and killing people of color seems to see no end. Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable. The cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long, long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself, only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste?This, folks, is why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER. No way in hell would this have happened if Angela Williams  son had been white.

" Fresh Off The Golf Course, Trump Lashes Out At FBI Deputy Director And James Comey","Donald Trump spent a good portion of his day at his golf club, marking the 84th day he s done so since taking the oath of office. It must have been a bad game because just after that, Trump lashed out at FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Twitter following a report saying McCabe plans to retire in a few months. The report follows McCabe s testimony in front of congressional committees this week, as well as mounting criticism from Republicans regarding the Russia probe.So, naturally, Trump attacked McCabe with a lie. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin  James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?

Trump has been fact-checked before on his claim of his wife receiving $700,000 for her campaign.Politifact noted in late July that Trump s  tweet about Andrew McCabe is a significant distortion of the facts. And the implication that McCabe got Clinton off as a political favor doesn t make much sense when we look at the evidence. His July tweet was rated  mostly false.  But Trump repeats these lies because he knows his supporters will believe them without bothering to Google. It s still a lie, though.Photo by Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images.",News,"December 23, 2017"
" Trump Said Some INSANELY Racist Stuff Inside The Oval Office, And Witnesses Back It Up","In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. Let s hope that more indictments from Robert Mueller are on their way as we speak.Featured image via Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images",News,"December 23, 2017"
" Former CIA Director Slams Trump Over UN Bullying, Openly Suggests He’s Acting Like A Dictator (TWEET)","Many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that Donald Trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. The thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. This was explained by Republican David Frum just a couple of months into Donald Trump s presidency, in a piece in The Atlantic called  How to Build an Autocracy. In fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well the direct weaponization of the Department of Justice in order to go after Trump s former political opponent, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and you have the makings of an autocracy. We are more than well on our way. Further, one chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, already has a rogue band of Republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official Russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that Trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the Russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.All of that is just for starters, too. Now, we have Trump making United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley bully and threaten other countries in the United Nations who voted against Trump s decision to change U.S. policy when it comes to recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish State. Well, one expert, who is usually quite measured, has had enough of Trump s autocratic antics: Former CIA Director John O. Brennan. The seasoned spy took to Trump s favorite platform, Twitter, and blasted the decision:Trump Admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in UN to oppose US position on Jerusalem is beyond outrageous. Shows @realDonaldTrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic, vengeful autocrats.  John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) December 21, 2017Director Brennan is correct, of course. Trump is behaving just like an autocrat, and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age, in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the American president. Fellow Americans, we know the GOP-led Congress will not be the check on Trump that they are supposed to be. It s time to get out and flip the House and possibly the Senate in 2018, and resist in the meantime, if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like Russia or North Korea than the America we have always know. We re already well on our way.Featured image via BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images",News,"December 22, 2017"

America First Policies is set to release this ad, called  Thank You, President Trump,  on Christmas Day and, well, we threw up a little in our mouths trying to watch this.Basically, the spot is nothing but people fawning all over Trump for all the stuff he hasn t actually done. The ad includes a scene with a little girl thanking Trump for bringing back  Merry Christmas,  which never went away (there are even videos of President Obama saying  Merry Christmas  himself). A man thanks him for cutting his taxes. And America First says that everyday Americans everywhere are thanking Trump for being such a great and awesome president.The best president.Nobody s ever done what he s done. He s breaking all kinds of records every day.Believe us.Anyway, the word  propaganda  comes to mind when watching this. That s what it is   literal propaganda promoting someone who shouldn t need this kind of promotion anymore. Watch this ad bullshit below:The way the MAGAs are kowtowing to Orange Hitler is both disgusting and frightening. The man has done nothing, and his policies will harm the very same Americans who are thanking him. Unfortunately, it will take an obscene amount of pain before they ll open their eyes and see they ve been duped by a con man with a bad hairdo.And his ongoing need for this kind of adoration is, at best, unbecoming of his office.

" Papa John’s Founder Retires, Figures Out Racism Is Bad For Business","A centerpiece of Donald Trump s campaign, and now his presidency, has been his white supremacist ways. That is why so many of the public feuds he gets into involve people of color. One of his favorite targets, is, of course, the players in the National Football League who dare to exercise their First Amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racist police brutality. Well, there is one person who has figured out that racism is bad for business, even if it did get the orange overlord elected: The founder of the pizza chain Papa John s.This is a man who has never been on the right side of history on any number of issues, and plus his pizza sucks. But, when he decided to complain about the players protesting, his sales really dropped. Turns out racism doesn t pay, and we all know that corporations are all about the bottom line. Therefore, Papa John Schnatter will no longer be CEO of the hack pizza chain.BREAKING: Papa John's founder John Schnatter to step down as CEO; announcement comes weeks after he criticized NFL over protests.  AP Business News (@APBusiness) December 21, 2017The thing is, while people are certainly allowed to have political opinions, they have to realize that those opinions can often come with dire consequences   especially if one is in the business of trying to garner sales and support from any and all people, which one would presume is the goal of all CEO s. No one knows whether or not the pressure from his shareholders, the public outcry or boycotts, or even the NFL itself had anything to do with his stepping down. As of right now, all we know is that he will be gone, and perhaps the future CEO will run a company that is inclusive of the diverse fabric that we call America. After all, the guiding symbol of this nation will always be the Statue of Liberty, and bigots like Trump and Schnatter are the past. The rest of us are the future.

Nothing could be further from the truth, and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly. Speaking on CNBC, Paul Ryan was going full throttle, trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money.But he didn t just go with the usual talking points. With a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know, Ryan claimed that the $2,059 more per year that families living paycheck-to-paycheck will see is extremely significant. Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600,000 per year (true), or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals to claim that Trump actually won the popular vote.

 Bad News For Trump — Mitch McConnell Says No To Repealing Obamacare In 2018,"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"December 21, 2017"
" WATCH: Lindsey Graham Trashes Media For Portraying Trump As ‘Kooky,’ Forgets His Own Words","The media has been talking all day about Trump and the Republican Party s scam of a tax bill; as well as the sheer obsequiousness of Trump s cabinet, and then members of Congress, after their tax scam was all but passed.

In other words, she is not Donald Trump, Paul Ryan or Bob Corker. Or Mitch McConnell. She is Abigail Disney, dammit. Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  But nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by Republicans to overhaul the tax system. Disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. And then she dropped a truth bomb. (We like truth bombs.)Republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. There is even a tax break to private jet owners. This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  Disney wrote.  It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too. With a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  Disney continued.  But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am. Does that strike you as fair? No, it does not, thankyouverymuch. But given how this bill was written, I think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from Pirates of the Caribbean,  Disney wrote.  Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.

 Tone Deaf Trump: Congrats Rep. Scalise On Losing Weight After You Almost Died,"Donald Trump just signed the GOP tax scam into law. Of course, that meant that he invited all of his craven, cruel GOP sycophants down from their perches on Capitol Hill to celebrate in the Rose Garden at the White House. Now, that part is bad enough   celebrating tax cuts for a bunch of rich hedge fund managers and huge corporations at the expense of everyday Americans. Of course, Trump is beside himself with glee, as this represents his first major legislative win since he started squatting in the White House almost a year ago. Thanks to said glee, in true Trumpian style, he gave a free-wheeling address, and a most curious subject came up as Trump was thanking the goons from the Hill. Somehow, Trump veered away from tax cuts, and started talking about the Congressional baseball shooting that happened over the summer.In that shooting, Rep. Steve Scalise, who is also the House Majority Whip, was shot and almost lost his life. Thanks to this tragic and stunning act of political violence, Scalise had a long recovery; in fact he is still in physical therapy. But, of course, vain and looks-obsessed Trump decided that he would congratulate Scalise, not on his survival and on his miraculous recovery, but on the massive amount of weight Scalise lost while he was practically dying. And make no mistake   Scalise is VERY lucky to be alive. According to doctors, when he arrived at the hospital, Scalise was actually, quote, in  imminent risk of death.  Here is the quote, via Twitter:How stunningly tone deaf does one have to be to say something like that? I never thought I d say this about a Republican that I, by all reasonable accounts, absolutely loathe, but I feel sorry for him. I am sorry he got shot, and I am even sorrier that he now has to stand there and listen to that orange buffoon talk about him like that.I am sure that Scalise is a much tougher man than Trump, though. I am equally sure that he also knows that Trump is an international embarrassment and a crazy man who never should have been allowed anywhere near the White House.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"December 20, 2017"

 Mueller Spokesman Just F-cked Up Donald Trump’s Christmas,"Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI. The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe. Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were  privileged communications. In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress  act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of   unlawful conduct  by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico. When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process,  he said.The words that pop out in the statement are  criminal investigation,  the  account owner s consent  and  criminal process. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails. After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams  emails illegally, even though that s not the truth. We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition. Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish. The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails. Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.",News,"December 17, 2017"
 SNL Hilariously Mocks Accused Child Molester Roy Moore For Losing AL Senate Race (VIDEO),"Right now, the whole world is looking at the shocking fact that Democrat Doug Jones beat Republican Roy Moore in the special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the United States Senate. Of course, Moore s candidacy was rocked by allegations of sexually harassing and even molesting teenage girls   and being banned from the mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama for doing so.Even before that, Moore was an incendiary character in Alabama politics, having been removed as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court not once but twice, and having made statements such as Muslims should not be allowed in Congress and homosexuality should be illegal. Hell, he even said that the last time America was great was when we had slavery. Therefore, he was an extraordinarily damaged candidate as it was. However, despite all of this, Alabama is a deep red state, with many voters agreeing with some of Moore s more extreme positions, and some even insisting that the allegations of sexual misconduct were simply not true. That is why it was such a shock that Doug Jones pulled out a win for that Senate seat.Well, there is one entity that could not resist going all in on the fact that Roy Moore lost this race: Saturday Night Live. While doing a caricature of the results, SNL began, with its Weekend Update host Colin Jost brutally mocking Moore s alleged proclivities fore teen girls: Congratulations to Alabama s newest Senator   not Roy Moore. Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in over 20 years. Said Roy Moore:  gross, over 20 years? Jost then got in a dig at Trump, for whom Moore s loss was  a humiliating failure, remind everyone what Trump said of Jones  win: The Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! Indeed. If the sane people of America have anything to say about it, it will be a very, very long time after 2018 before the GOP is allowed to control anything. Jost continued mocking Trump: That s it? You just went all in for an accused pedophile and when he lost, [you re] just like,  well, we had fun! He could be removed from office tonight and tweet:  Congratulations to Robert Mueller on a great investigation. Had a fun time being president. Catch you on the flippity-flop! #DietCokeTime . Oh, if only that could be our reality, to have Trump congratulating Mueller for removing him and his entire treasonous, criminal administration. Until then, we ll have to stick to  Weekend Update  and the rest of SNL, and hope for the best.Watch the video below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"December 17, 2017"

" In A Heartless Rebuke To Victims, Trump Invites NRA To Xmas Party On Sandy Hook Anniversary","It almost seems like Donald Trump is trolling America at this point. In the beginning, when he tried to gaslight the country by insisting that the crowd at his inauguration was the biggest ever   or that it was even close to the last couple of inaugurations   we all kind of scratched our heads and wondered what kind of bullshit he was playing at. Then when he started appointing people to positions they had no business being in, we started to worry that this was going to go much worse than we had expected.After 11 months of Donald Trump pulling the rhetorical equivalent of whipping his dick out and slapping it on every table he gets near, I think it s time we address what s happening: Dude is a straight-up troll. He gets pleasure out of making other people uncomfortable or even seeing them in distress. He actively thinks up ways to piss off people he doesn t like.Let s set aside just for a moment the fact that that s the least presidential  behavior anyone s ever heard of   it s dangerous.His latest stunt is one of the grossest yet.Everyone is, by now, used to Trump not talking about things he doesn t want to talk about, and making a huge deal out of things that not many people care about. So it wasn t a huge surprise when the president didn t discuss the Sandy Hook shooting of 2012 on the fifth anniversary of that tragic event. What was a huge surprise was that he not only consciously decided not to invite the victims  families to the White House Christmas party this year   as they have been invited every year since the massacre took place, along with others who share those concerns.In each of the past 4 years, President Obama invited gun violence prevention activists, gun violence survivors (including the Sandy Hook families) and supportive lawmakers to his Christmas party. Zero gun lobbyists were in attendance. pic.twitter.com/QePW9FtbSh  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017The last sentence of that tweet is important, because that s exactly who Donald Trump did invite to the White House Christmas party. Instead of victims. On the anniversary day.Yesterday was the 5 year mark of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook School, which went unacknowledged by the President. On the same day, he hosted a White House Christmas party to which he invited @NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre. Here he is at the party with @DanPatrick. pic.twitter.com/mUbKCIWGxB  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017Wayne LaPierre is the man who, in response to the Sandy Hook massacre, finally issued a statement that blamed gun violence on music, movies, and video games, and culminated with perhaps the greatest bit of irony any man has ever unintentionally conceived of: Isn t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? Yes. Yes, it is, Wayne.Anyway, Happy Holidays Merry Christmas from Donald Trump, everyone!Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"December 16, 2017"
 KY GOP State Rep. Commits Suicide Over Allegations He Molested A Teen Girl (DETAILS),"In this #METOO moment, many powerful men are being toppled. It spans many industries, from entertainment, to journalism, to politics and beyond. Any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass, molest, or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out, publicly shamed, and forced into early retirement.Well, unfortunately, the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker. Kentucky State Representative Dan Johnson left a suicide note on Facebook and then shot himself on a bridge, according to reports from local authorities. Bullitt County Sheriff Donnie Tinnell reported to local station WDRB that Johnson s body was found after his suicide note from Facebook was reported to the local police. Here is that note:Now, nobody wants to celebrate a suicide. This man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser, who was a friend of his daughter s, who says that Johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home. Apparently, Johnson, who referred to himself as some kind of  pope,  routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors. Johnson s home was called the  Pope s House,  and he was the preacher at the Heart of Fire City Church, where the alleged molestation took place.Now, innocent until proven guilty and all of that, but if someone commits suicide, it s likely there could be some merit there. That s a rather extreme measure to take. Further, by all accounts, this guy was no saint. He was heavily pro-gun, opposed any and all abortion rights, and has referred to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys on his Facebook page, among other racist messages and images.Again, we re not glad the man is dead. But, it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was. We grieve for the loss his children, wife, and grandchildren suffered, for nobody deserves such a loss. However, methinks the people of Kentucky are much better off. Sad to say, but true.Featured image via screen capture",News,"December 13, 2017"
 Meghan McCain Tweets The Most AMAZING Response To Doug Jones’ Win In Deep-Red Alabama,"As a Democrat won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, social media offered up everyone s opinion because that s what social media does. Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated accused pedophile and serial sexual assaulter Roy Moore in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed Attorney General. And some Republicans aren t exactly heartbroken about this.Take Meghan McCain   John McCain s daughter. She went right after one of Trump s biggest supporters Steve Bannon as soon as the election results were announced:Suck it, Bannon  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 13, 2017Three simple words. It s amazing what three simple words can say.Steve Bannon spoke at Moore s election night rally, which we assume was supposed to be a night of celebration. Bannon endorsed Moore early on, against Luther Strange, whom Donald Trump himself campaigned for earlier this year. Bannon s support for Moore remained steadfast even in the wake of multiple allegations surfaced against him of sexual assault, harassment and even pedophilia. Bannon even said,  There s a special place in hell  for those who refuse to support Moore.On Dec. 12, the people of Alabama rejected Roy Moore s penchant for pursuing, even assaulting, teenage girls. They rejected his hate and bigotry. They rejected an asshat who has been removed from Alabama s Supreme Court twice for violating federal court orders, thus demonstrating he has no respect for the rule of law. And they sent a message to the Republican Party that this bullshit will no longer be tolerated. If deep-red Alabama can elect a Democrat, then anyone can. And that should have Republicans scared out of their minds.Well, we re going there, along with Meghan McCain and anyone else who believed Moore shouldn t ever hold public office. Even Republicans have their limits, it seems.Featured image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2017"
 CNN CALLS IT: A Democrat Will Represent Alabama In The Senate For The First Time In 25 Years,"Alabama is a notoriously deep red state. It s a place where Democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections. However, that is just what happened on Tuesday night in the Special Election to replace Senator Jeff Sessions. Doug Jones, the Democratic Senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a church during the Civil Rights Movement and killed four little African American girls, will be the next Senator from Alabama. CNN has just called the race, as there seems no more GOP-leaning counties out there.To contrast, Roy Moore had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court as Chief Justice for violating the law, and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls. Despite all of that, though, the race was a nail biter, because Moore has a long history and a deep base in Alabama. Of course, decent people   including Republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like Roy Moore going to the Senate. Despite the allegations of sexual predation, Moore also had said many incendiary things, such as putting forth the idea that Muslims shouldn t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, and that America was great when slavery was legal. And that s just for starters, too.Thank you Alabama, for letting sanity prevail in this race. Oh, and a message to Democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere. Get a fifty state strategy going so we can blow the GOP outta the water in 2018.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2017"
 White House: It Wasn’t Sexist For Trump To Slut-Shame Sen.

Trump was calling Gillibrand a whore.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders somehow denied that Trump s tweet was sexist. There is no way that is sexist at all,  Sanders told reporters.Then Sanders tried to explain what Trump really meant (we all know what he really meant). According to Sanders, Trump was merely accusing Gillibrand of being  controlled by contributions,  and hammering home his pledge to  drain the swamp  in Washington, according to The Hill. I think that the president is very obvious,  she said.  This is the same sentiment the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed the corruption of the entire political system. Sanders claims that Trump does not owe Gillibrand an apology if his words were taken as sexist. I think only if your mind is in the gutter you would have read it that way, so no,  she said.Watch:Gillibrand called on Trump to resign after Trump s accusers came back into the spotlight by hosting a press conference in which they called for an investigation into his past behavior.

We already knew that Donald Trump was a sexist asshole, but this is a new low, even for him.General Kelly, General McMaster, and whomever else is running that White House   DO SOMETHING about this fool s Twitter habit. It is way out of control, and he does great damage to the nation with ever 140 280 character outburst. This is outrageous.

 Accused Child Molesting Senate Candidate Roy Moore Sides With Putin Over Reagan (VIDEO),"Ronald Reagan is largely seen as the Messiah of the Republican Party. Despite how long it has been since the man was president, he has always remained the high standard of GOP morality for potential office holders. That is, until now. Reagan is likely rolling over in his grave at the idea of the state of his party with Donald Trump as its standard-bearer, and he s likely doing the same at the prospect of a bigoted accused child molester like Roy Moore (R-AL) being the next GOP Senator from Alabama. Well, now Reagan has another reason to hate Moore: He s clearly in the pocket of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin just like Donald Trump is.During an interview where he s talking about Americans being the face of  evil  in the world right now, Moore indicates that Putin s harsh and murderous treatment of LGBTQ people in Russia is something he would like to see happen in the United States. Then, he does something most appalling, and goes on to give Putin a message in Russian. Now, no one knows where a bigoted, backwoods buffoon like Roy Moore would learn Russian. After all, he s barely left Alabama, where he has spent the last 40+ years wreacking havoc and just basically cementing Alabama s place as America s bigoted boil on the butt of humanity wherever and whenever he can. However, he managed to learn enough Russian to dog whistle to Putin in that interview. That should disturb us all. Not only is the man being a homophobe, a racist, a misogynist, and more than likely a child molester, he s also a Russian stooge.America, we can do better. We have enough Russian puppets at the highest levels of government. Lord knows we don t need one in the United States Senate.Watch the appalling video below:Please watch this until the end, Roy Moore sides with Putin over Reagan, says that America is the focus of evil in the world, and sends a nice message to Putin in Russian. pic.twitter.com/wFgDkvzEhT  The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) December 10, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 11, 2017"

On Saturday night, Pirro said there needs to be a  cleansing  at the FBI and the Department of Justice.Pirro claims that quite a few officials are protecting Hillary Clinton   who does not hold public office   or are destroying Donald Trump, and singled out Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, FBI official Peter Strzok, former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, former FBI Director James Comey and you guessed it: Special Counsel Robert Mueller   all of whom she says need to be arrested and placed in handcuffs. There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made,  she shrieked.  This is one of those times. There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice   it needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired. But who need to be taken out in cuffs,  Pirro declared.Watch:.@JudgeJeanine:  There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made.

For that, he was sentenced to spend over two years  locked up  in prison for improperly deducting $1.2 million of his personal expenses as business write-offs while living a lavish lifestyle. Mr. Pirro was convicted on all 34 counts.Pirro split with her hubby after he admitted to fathering a child with another woman. He told the press and Pirro failed to give him enough attention. I know! Maybe if he changed his name to Hillary Clinton then he d get all the attention he needs.Pirro s hatred for Hillary Clinton goes way back and it appears to stem from jealousy.Maybe Pirro should heed the advice from Pirro in 2016 when she said,  We cannot have a country run by a president subject to ongoing criminal investigations, potential indictments and never-ending hearings [W]hether she s indicted or even guilty, it doesn t matter.

" BREAKING: Cop Finally Gets His Due, Walter Scott’s Killer Sentenced To Prison (DETAILS)","In America, we have been having a conversation about police brutality against black Americans. Despite the countless black people murdered unjustly by police, there is usually no justice. Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Keith Lamont Scott, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray too many to mention here, really. All of those people were senselessly murdered by cops who chose to be their judges, juries, and executioners, and they did so with impunity and without consequence. However, there is hope, and it is coming out of South Carolina, of all places.North Charleston police officer Michael Slager murdered Walter Scott, a black man who was fleeing after a routine traffic stop in cold blood in 2015. He would have gotten away with it, too, had it not been for a citizen who was brave enough to tape the murder. The tape showed that Slager had lied about his life being in danger, and it showed him cuffing Scott s lifeless body, and then planting a taser as  evidence.  Here is the news report of that damning tape:Thanks to that tape, Slager was arrested and charged with murder. Now, fast forward two years later, and Slager has been convicted of murder. U.S. District Judge David Norton decided to throw the book at Slager, and sentenced the murdering ex-cop to 19-24 years in prison.The original case ended in a mistrial, but the state of South Carolina seemed determined to get justice for Walter Scott, and that happened on December 7, 2017.  Of course, Slager s family begged for mercy from the judge, but luckily those calls were ignored. Michael Slager is a murderer, and he deserves the sentence he got.So many times, these cases end with the murderous cops back on the force, out in the streets after what amounts to nothing more than a paid vacation, free to murder another black person at will again. Thankfully, for once, the system worked as it should. For once, I am proud to be a South Carolinian. Hopefully this sets a precedent, and helps us turn a corner toward the arc of justice.Watch the video of the remarks of the Scott family below: Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images",News,"December 7, 2017"
 Watch: Is This Proof Trump Is Unfit for Service?,"New questions are being asked about President Donald Trump s ability to lead after he slurred his words during a speech about his Jerusalem decision. Possible reasons for this include: fatigue, a dry mouth (the White House explanation), the use of drugs or alcohol, a problem with his dentures or more troubling issues dealing with his mental or physical health. Morning Joe reported this morning that, unlike other presidents, Trump has opted not to get his physicals at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.Questions about Trump s mental stability have been growing over the last few months. While he has never been viewed as a stable person in the traditional sense, his tweets and comments have gotten more erratic. He was widely criticized recently when he retweeted several anti-Muslim videos that were posted by radicals in the United Kingdom.One psychiatrist talk to MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnel about his impressions of Trump s state of mind.Many think that any degradation in Trump s mental state may be due to the increased pressure he is feeling from Robert Mueller s investigations into collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. This has increased since former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.All of this talk is leading to more people to ask if Trump should be removed from office, citing the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Jamie D. Raskin (D-MD) has circulated a  dear colleague  letter suggesting just that. As published in the Washington Post, it says: Please join a rapidly growing group of colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 1987, the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. It sets up and defines the Congressionally-appointed  body  called for by the 25th Amendment. Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, the Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet or the Vice-President and a majority of  such other body as Congress may by law provide  can determine that the President is for reasons of physical or mental incapacity unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. The 25th Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1967, but in the last 50 years Congress never created the  body  that its language contemplated. Perhaps it never occurred to prior Congresses that setting up this body was necessary. For obvious reasons, it is indeed necessary, and now is the time for us to do it. While the Republicans in the Cabinet and Congress may not yet be ready to take this step, it is out there.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"December 7, 2017"
" Trump Completely SCREWS The Middle East Peace Process, Just Another Wednesday For Him","On Wednesday, Donald Trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider. He has declared that the United States now officially recognizes the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of Israel.While Trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in effect gives the city to the Israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that Trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. Mustafa Marghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told Al-Jazeera that: This is not a single act. This US administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. This American administration did not say or mention the words  Palestinian state  once. This American administration has failed to exercise any pressure on Israel on the issue of settlements, although Israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since President Trump was elected. Many expect to see outrage across the Middle East as news of the decision comes in.The European Union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   Israel AND Palestine.Just as he does here at home, Trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. Both the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. But the decision does make Trump s evangelical supporters in America happy. Their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the Jewish state and evangelicalism. According to Christian traditions, the Jews will all die in the Apocalypse, as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs.No wonder they re mostly Republicans.Watch Trump s announcement here:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"December 6, 2017"
 Trump Only Cares About Trump; Why He Is Recognizing Jerusalem Today,"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. Trump wants to divert attention from Robert Mueller s investigation. It is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that Deutsche Bank has received subpoenas for information on the Trump family s assets, that this Jerusalem decision was announced. What could be a bigger news story than getting this information? A blow up in the Middle East.Look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. American allies throughout the Middle East and Europe have asked Trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. US News and World Report put this out today: The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. It is worth noting that while Trump will formally announce that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. In fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. This move is necessary due to the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which mandated the embassy be moved. It also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.The Atlantic has even compared this decision to Trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a U.S. president goes to war with Albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. The film was viewed as a parody of President Bill Clinton s military actions in Afghanistan and Sudan after he acknowledged an affair with Monica Lewinsky.While whether or not Clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with Lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that Trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. Catherine Rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the Washington Post. She wrote: Welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. Trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. Experts in the Middle East fear that the Jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. Many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. His thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.By making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, Trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the United States.Featured image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.",News,"December 6, 2017"
 Watch: Trump Supporting Coal CEO Upset Trump Is Wiping Out ‘Thousands’ Of Coal Mining Jobs,"While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to revive the coal industry and after he took power, he signed an executive order rolling back a temporary ban on mining coal and a stream protection rule that was imposed by the Obama administration. Trump vowed to bring back thousands of mining jobs in struggling rural areas.  I made them this promise,  Trump said,  we will put our miners back to work. That was then and this is now.Coal CEO Robert Murray, a fierce supporter of Trump s, warns that if the Senate version of tax reform is enacted by the current occupant of the White House, he will be destroying thousands of coal mining jobs in the process.Murray said the Senate legislation will raise Murray Energy s taxes by $60 million a year,  notwithstanding the other so-called benefits the Senate has proposed,  CNBC reports. This means that very capital-intensive, highly leveraged employers, like coal-mining companies, will be forced out of business, with tragic consequences for our families and for many regions of our country,  Murray said. We won t have enough cash flow to exist. It wipes us out,  Murray told CNNMoney in an interview on Tuesday. This wipes out everything that President Trump has done for coal,  said Murray, the head of one of America s largest coal companies.CNN reports:Murray warned that a bankruptcy of his Ohio-based company would hurt its 5,500 employees along with their families. Asked if other coal mining companies could go out of business, he said:  Most certainly. Watch:Murray hosted a fundraiser for Trump during the campaign. And today, Murray warns that the GOP tax plan will  wipe out  coal mining jobs.Who saw this coming? Besides all of us. Trump supporters have been suckered.Image via screen capture.

" Sitting GOP Senator Has Had ENOUGH, Donates To Alabama Democrat For Senate (IMAGE)","Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake has never been a fan of Donald Trump or his incendiary, divisive brand of politics. Now, he is a leading GOP voice against electing Roy Moore (R-AL) to the United States Senate. Moore is an accused child molester, and has a lifetime history of making all kinds of bigoted and incendiary comments. He has said that homosexuality should be illegal, and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. Moore was also removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for refusing to comply with higher court rulings. Well, Flake has finally had enough of his party enabling characters like Moore. He had already said that if he lived in Alabama, he d be voting for Democrat Doug Jones. Now, Flake  has taken his support of Jones even further, in the wake of the Republican National Committee s decision to support an accused child molester rather than a Democrat.Taking to Twitter, Senator Flake posted an image of a check   made out to Doug Jones  Senate campaign. Here is the tweet, captioned  Country over Party :Country over Party pic.twitter.com/JZMTaEYdxQ  Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 5, 2017Now, I don t agree with Jeff Flake on anything politically, but I can say that he is trying to act with morality and decency here. One could argue that Flake s plans to retire from the Senate mean that he can do this without consequence, but at this point, that matters not. We do not need a pedophile in the United States Senate, and the GOP apparatus should be ashamed of themselves for trying to get Roy Moore elected. But, hey   better a pedophile than a Democrat, right?Featured image Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 5, 2017"
 Republican National Committee: Better A Pedophile Than A Democrat In The U.S. Senate,"By now, the whole world knows that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R-Of Course) was banned from an Alabama mall and the YMCA for creeping on little girls. He has been accused of molesting young girls as young as age fourteen. Of course, when the allegations first came out and the uproar and backlash began, everyone, regardless of politics, reacted with outrage. However, the GOP s outrage was often much more muted. Further, it took awhile for the Republican National Committee to pull their support for Moore, despite the deeply disturbing allegations of his being a pedophile. Well, now that the rage has died down, the RNC is back with a new message regarding this Senate race: Better a pedophile than a Democrat.Under cover of night, the RNC reinstated their support for Roy Moore, and an RNC official confirmed to The Hill that, quote, We can confirm our involvement in the Alabama Senate race. So, there you have it, folks. They literally want a child molester in the United States Senate rather than a Democrat. There are only a few voices from the right who are being brave on this one   and none of them are seeking re-election. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney tweeted that the GOP must not tolerate Moore:Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) December 4, 2017Outgoing Arizona GOP Senator Jeff Flake has actually said that he would vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, if he lived in Alabama, and former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller has actually endorsed and donated to Jones.

Here s the video of Dent s takedown of Moore:There is also outspoken Trump critic and longtime GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who went on national television and called Moore a pedophile:Other than that, though, it has been radio silence.

 Donald Trump’s Eating Habits Could Be Dramatically Affecting His Wellbeing And Our Safety,"We ve all heard the stories of Donald Trump preferring a well-done steak with ketchup and shunning any new delicacies, despite living a lifestyle that offers him all the luxuries one could ever desire, however, it s not just that the President has terrible gastronomical taste, a new memoir suggests that his diet is one of several poor lifestyle choices that could very well shorten his life.According to an excerpt from Let Trump be Trump, an upcoming book by Trump s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and aide David Bossie, we get to enter the inner circle where the President of the United States having a 2,400-calorie McDonald s dinner is par for the course. Trump s appetite seems to know no bounds when it comes to McDonald s, with a dinner order consisting of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,  is just one of the claims made in the book. To put that meal in perspective, Trump s dinner contains 3,400 grams of sodium, despite the American Heart Foundation recommending just 1,500 grams per day, plus enough white bread to last most people a week. Remember, this is just one meal, but it only gets worse. On Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza, and Diet Coke,  the authors write about traveling with Trump during the early days of his presidency, but there may be a valid reason for it   Not only is he a fan of manufacturing, Trump is also a renowned germaphobe who allegedly won t eat from a package that has already been opened, which would also explain the plane s cupboards being stacked with Vienna Fingers, potato chips, pretzels, and many packages of Oreos.  Those well-done steaks make a little more sense now, as well. But a little bit of bacteria is probably the least of the President s worries. This is a 71-year-old man who gets next to no exercise (it s hard to include his golf when he barely even walks while playing), gets very little sleep, and is constantly throwing tantrums, so add in that diet and you have the perfect recipe for a heart attack. The diet alone, especially the snacks, is almost an open-invite for diabetes, too.What makes this frightening for the rest of us is that this is a man who is currently responsible for a nuclear standoff with North Korea, as well as dealing with rapidly warming oceans and an ever-increasing tax bill. If he has this lack of concern for his own wellbeing, then what does it say of his risk-assessment abilities?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"December 5, 2017"

Being the Republican Senator for Arizona, some may have seen this as him just batting for his own team, but let s not forget that John McCain was one of the few glimmers of hope as he was also one of the only Republicans that has been openly critical of President Trump and this is a terrible tax bill.Not only will the new tax measures raise taxes on those earning less than $75,000 per annum, it would also take healthcare from 13 million Americans and raise the national debt by almost $1.5 trillion dollars over the coming decade! To add insult to injury, the 479-page bill wasn t even completed when it was released on Friday night, with some pages crossed out and others with hand-written amendments in the margins. Furthermore, nobody even had a chance to read it when they were forced to vote on it, but that didn t sway McCain and the bill somehow managed to pass the Senate.UPDATE: Senate Republicans are so desperate to pass their tax bill tonight that they're now making handwritten changes to their already handwritten changes Seriously. pic.twitter.com/KQfW7bOyk1  Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) December 2, 2017Some people had grown to believe that Senator McCain wasn t too bad for a Republican, but when he shocked everyone and voted in favor of the new tax bill, one where 13 million taxpayers will lose their healthcare but still subsidize his treatment for brain cancer, he proved he was no different and people decided to revolt.

 ‘Ghost Of Witness Flipped’: Hilarious SNL Skit Takes Trump Into His Own Private Holiday Hell (VIDEO),"By now, everyone knows that disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has flipped on Donald Trump. Of course, the good folks at Saturday Night Live, who have been mocking Trump relentlessly, couldn t resist using this to needle the notoriously thin -skinned, sorry excuse for a  president.  It also helps that we are in the midst of the holiday season, which enabled SNL to use a seasonal classic, A Christmas Carol, to poke fun at Trump.Alec Baldwin took up the mantle to play Trump again, who is visited by a fictional Michael Flynn (Mikey Day) in chains, and seems positively terrified of the Ghost of Michael Flynn, who appears to tell Trump, it s time to come clean for the good of the country.  After that, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future line up to torture Trump in the Oval Office.The Ghost of Christmas Past is fired NBC host Billy Bush (Alex Moffat), of Trump s infamous  grab em by the pussy  tape. Then it was time for a shirtless Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennet) to arrive, to remind Trump of the fact that he wouldn t be president without help from the Russian government, and that he s about to have all of their efforts be for naught. The Ghost of Christmas Future is the best of all, with a positively wickedly delicious version of Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, who gleefully says to Trump: You Donald, have given me the greatest Christmas gift of all! You have no idea how long I ve wanted to say this,  lock him up! Lock him up indeed. This entire criminal administration belongs in jail. It will go from Flynn, to Pence, to Trump Jr., and then to Trump himself   and then Hillary will really have the last laugh.",News,"December 3, 2017"
 Leaked Email Proves Trump Officials Aware Russia Had ‘Thrown The USA Election’ To Trump,"Donald Trump s current deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News personality, K. T. McFarland admitted in an email to a colleague during the 2016 presidential transition to Russia throwing the election to Trump. The leaked email was written just weeks before Trump s inauguration and it states that sanctions would make it difficult to ease relations with Russia,  which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him. The New York Times reports:But emails among top transition officials, provided or described to The New York Times, suggest that Mr. Flynn was far from a rogue actor. In fact, the emails, coupled with interviews and court documents filed on Friday, showed that Mr. Flynn was in close touch with other senior members of the Trump transition team both before and after he spoke with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about American sanctions against Russia.A White House lawyer tried to explain McFarland s email to the The Times by saying that she was referring to the Democrats  portrayal of the election. That doesn t make any sense, by the way.McFarland wrote the email to Thomas P. Bossert, who currently serves as Trump s homeland security adviser, then he forwarded it to future National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (now indicted), future Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, future senior strategist Stephen Bannon, and future press secretary Sean Spicer, the Daily Beast reports.With all the pearl-clutching we witnessed from conservatives about Hillary Clinton s emails, you d think they wouldn t be sending messages about Russia throwing the election to Trump.This past March, John Oliver, the host of the HBO comedy show Last Week Tonight started a segment called  Stupid Watergate,  which he described as  a scandal with all the potential ramifications of Watergate, but where everyone involved is stupid and bad at everything.

There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,  he said at the time.After Flynn left, Trump defended him, calling the disgraced former national security adviser a  wonderful man. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said in February.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. When Flynn resigned, he apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Mike Pence, who, at the time, was the vice-president elect.Pence then said that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.The day after Flynn resigned, Trump, according to then-FBI Director James Comey, asked him to  let go  of an investigation into Flynn.Trump admitted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, then he asked Comey to drop the investigation.

 Watch This Awesome Mashup of Michael Flynn Leading The ‘Lock Her Up’ Chant As He Goes Off To Court (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has just plead guilty to lying to the FBI   a felony.

The irony here is beyond delicious   especially since Flynn infamously led the  LOCK HER UP!  chants at the 2016 Republican National Convention, saying that Hillary Clinton was some kind of criminal, and that if Trump was elected they d be able to put her in jail, where many Trump supporters believe she belongs. Well, now the tables are turned, and it is Flynn who will be heading to jail, and the people who realize who the REAL criminals are have been having a field day.

 White House Panics Knowing Flynn Is Going To Take Them Down,"While Donald Trump has been taking vacations, special counsel Robert Mueller has been working hard on the Russia investigation. Instead of golfing this weekend, we suggest that the former reality show star huddle with his lawyers. Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador and he s fully cooperating with Mueller. As part of the plea deal, Flynn admitted that he was directed by a senior member of the Trump transition team to make contact with Russian officials in December. In addition, Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump as a candidate, ordered him to make contacts with the Russians.This marks the first instance of solid proof that there was collusion between team Trump and a hostile foreign government.On Friday, just after the news broke, the White House insisted that Flynn s guilty plea will not implicate Trump or anyone else in the White House.The White House said in a statement that Flynn was fired for making false statements to Trump officials, and that he worked for the administration for a short time   and that he was a former Obama administration official. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,  said White House lawyer Ty Cobb.  Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The White House then referred to Flynn as the  former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days  as well as  a former Obama administration official. However, the White House left out a few important details. President Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he also warned Trump about Flynn during a discussion two days after the election and emphasized that he had concerns about him joining the national security team for the new president.On top of that, just after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump called him a  wonderful man  who was treated unfairly by the media.Photo by David Becker/Getty Images.",News,"December 1, 2017"
 BREAKING: Michael Flynn CRACKS – Will Testify To Mueller Against Trump Himself,"Michael Flynn, Trump s embattled former national security adviser, has reportedly caved in and will testify to Robert Mueller and his team about Trump s collusion with Russia.

Most importantly, he admitted in his plea that officials on Trump s transition team directed his contacts with Russian officials.Furthermore, according to CNN s David Wright on Twitter, there s more to it than that. He s reporting that Brian Ross, who reported for ABC News, said that Flynn also says he s prepared to testify that Trump himself  ordered him, directed him, to make contact with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point. .@BrianRoss reports Michael Flynn  is prepared to testify that President Trump as a candidate   Donald Trump   ordered him, directed him, to make contacts with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point.

David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017For his part, Flynn issued a statement saying the following: Actions I acknowledged in court today are wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions. The White House has said that this is merely more of what got Flynn fired in the first place, and that this will have zero effect on Trump.

 Trump Gets An Epic F**ck You From Britain Over His White Supremacist Retweets,"Donald Trump has a white supremacy problem, and now it is causing Great Britain, America s closest ally, to rebuke him in an historically public way. After Trump retweeted the leader of Britain First, a fascist white nationalist group, Prime Minister Theresa May decided she had had enough. She publicly criticized Trump, and made it clear that she in no way approved of his identifying with Britain First. May said of Trump s tweets: The fact that we work together does not mean that we re afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them. And I m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do. May went on to call Britain First a  hateful organization  that has caused division in her nation. Now, it seems that a so-called  working visit  that had been planned soon for Trump in Britain will now be cancelled.Trump, of course, instead of trying to patch things up in the  special relationship  that has always existed between the United States and Great Britain, decided to attack the Prime Minister of our closest and most important ally   again, of course, via Twitter:.@Theresa_May, don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.

 This Hilarious Campaign Ad Shows Voters How They Can Avoid Scandalous Elected Officials,"In Michigan, the upcoming election in 2018 presents voters with an interesting option: They could, for the first time, have an all-female  ticket  for every major office being contested. Senator Debbie Stabenow is up for re-election, and odds are good that the nominees for Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State will all be women.At least one of those candidates thinks that s a very good thing. Democratic candidate for AG Dana Nessel has produced a campaign ad that capitalizes on the benefits of being female when it comes to running for public office. Namely, the fact that she doesn t have a d*ck to wave at every passerby.With the wave of allegations over the last few weeks, beginning with the outing of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a total pervert and a sexual predator, it seems like everywhere you look there s someone else being ousted from their position or job for having at least acted like a pig   and in some cases the allegations are even worse.Of course, not everyone is suffering from the paradigm shift that has stoked bravery in women across America and around the world. The highest office in the country is, of course, occupied by a man who s been accused by at least 19 women of everything from sexual harassment to actual inappropriate physical touching. And the open US Senate seat in Alabama is currently being contested by, on the Democratic side, the guy who successfully prosecuted the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four young black girls, and on the Republican side, a guy who s accused of pursuing, dating, and touching teenage girls as young as 14 when he was an Assistant District Attorney in his 30 s.Dana Nessel wants to help you avoid all of that unseemly contact with potentially predatory men by simply not being one: [W]hen you re choosing Michigan s next attorney general, ask yourself this: Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting? Is it the candidate who doesn t have a penis? I d say so. Watch the amazing ad here:Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"November 30, 2017"
 Joe Scarborough: It’s Not Our Imagination – Trump Really Is Losing His Mind (VIDEO),"People have long speculated about Donald Trump s mental state. While it was once seen as unseemly to suggest that a public figure may be crazy, Trump s alarming behavior warrants an exception   especially since he has the nuclear codes. Well, it s not our imagination   and that s not just because we can see with every wild statement and unhinged Twitter rant that something is wrong with Trump. It s because, according to former Republican Congressman and current host of MSNBC s Morning Joe reported on Thursday that several of Trump s allies confided to him that Trump has dementia.Then, Scarborough went all in, and called for the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, and in doing so, decided to list many of Trump s infamous incidences of con artistry in the process: If this is not what the 25th Amendment was drafted for, I would like the Cabinet members serving America   not the president   you serve America, and you know it. You know you don t serve Donald J. Trump. Scam developer, scam Trump University proprietor, reality TV show host. You don t represent him. You represent 320 million people whose lives are literally in your hands, and we are facing a showdown with a nuclear power. You have somebody inside the White House that the New York Daily News says is mentally unfit. That people close to him say is mentally unfit, that people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia. This is astounding. Joe Scarborough is no liberal. I disagree with a lot of what he says, but he s definitely putting his country before his party, and doing the right thing.

 Sources Confirm Robert Mueller’s Office Interviewed Jared Kushner Several Weeks Ago,"Jared Kushner, senior White House adviser and son-in-law of President Donald Trump, was interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller s office at the beginning of November, according to a source familiar with the process. As part of an interview that lasted approximately 90 minutes, Kushner was quizzed mainly on his interactions, meetings, and any general contact he had with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, as well as his son, in regards to Flynn s private business dealings with his firm, Flynn Intel Group. Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so,  Kushner s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement given to NBC News.The news of Kushner s interview first came to light when grand jury testimony related to Flynn s private business dealings was postponed by prosecutors working for Mueller, the reason for which is still unclear. This postponement came just a week after Flynn s attorneys alerted President Trump s legal team that information related to the case could no longer be shared between the two parties, nor are they allowed to publicly comment on the matter. It is not uncommon for defense teams to share information, but the practice is considered unethical once a conflict of interest arises, not that Donald Trump has ever been particularly concerned with matters as trivial as  ethics. The fact that Flynn s attorneys are no longer sharing information with Trump s legal team is in no way proof that Flynn is cooperating with the special counsel, but it is a decent sign that he is working with them, but Trump s team has been expecting this for quite some time. It is probably a plea deal,  Jay Sekulow, a member of President Trump s legal team, told CBS News earlier in the month.  That is the assumption. And if it is a plea that doesn t necessarily mean it has anything to do with the president. The Manafort indictment didn t have anything to do with the campaign or Trump. Michael Flynn served as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency until he was fired from the position in 2014 by former President Barack Obama, however, he still retained a security clearance, even during Trump s presidential campaign and transition into the White House until Flynn s role was terminated 23 days into Trump s presidency. Any possible cooperation Flynn has with the prosecution could give Mueller s counsel insight into the Trump campaign s operations and potential dealings with Russia, as well as the first few weeks of his presidency.The FBI is already looking into both Flynn s Trump lobbying and Flynn Intel Group s research work for an unfinished film for which the firm was paid $530,000 by a Turkish businessman. Employees of Sphere Consulting, who did public relations work on the film, have been turning over documents requested by Mueller s investigators and sitting for voluntary interviews for several months.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",News,"November 30, 2017"
 Trump Sends Crazy-Time Tweet To The Wrong Account After Losing His Sh*t Over World Leader’s Remarks,"Donald Trump retweeted fake news videos in the early hours of the morning and for that, he was widely condemned. The White House responded to say that it doesn t matter if the former reality show star posted fake videos about Muslims because  the threat is real!  Scary, huh? A backlash ensued after Trump retweeted three times from a woman who was convicted of a hate crime in the U.K.The current occupant of the White House is upset because British Prime Minister Theresa May responded to Trump s widely condemned retweets this morning, saying,  It is wrong for the president to have done this.  In a statement, Downing street further said,  Britain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people. Members of British Parliament also condemned Trump s retweets.So naturally, Trump lashed out on Twitter at our ally s leader.

 Americans Once Elected A President After He Was Accused Of Raping A 13-Year-Old Girl,"After an awful campaign filled with hateful rhetoric, American voters elected a man to lead the most powerful country on earth even after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old. The year was 2016 and the accused was an alleged billionaire, former reality show star and an admitted sexual predator. Still, even after the revelations, conservatives saw nothing wrong with Donald Trump s behavior. The plaintiff described the horrifying incident in which Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein allegedly raped a child. A lawsuit was filed which claims that threats were made in order for the victim to keep her mouth shut about what had just happened.Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability, and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.There was a witness who backed up  Jane Doe s  claims. According to the lawsuit, Trump and Epstein  sexually and physically  abused the then 13-year-old plaintiff and forced her  to engage in various perverted and depraved sex acts    including being  forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm,  and being  forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe, age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump    after luring her to a  series of underage sex parties  by promising her  money and a modeling career,  according to Snopes.Trump has admitted knowing Epstein for 15 years. Epstein was named in multiple similar lawsuits, served 13 months in jail, and is registered as a sex offender for life.The lawsuit which was filed in California on April 26, 2016, was dismissed over technical filing errors and it was refiled in June of the same year, then dropped again in November after the plaintiff received death threats.Last year, Trump was also accused by 16 women of sexually harassing or assaulting them. Conservatives went on to elect him knowing full well that he is a sexual predator because he said so in the Access Hollywood tape.History will not be kind as it remembers November of 2016.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"November 29, 2017"
" Trump’s Biggest KKK Fan Is Back, And He Just LOVED Those Anti-Muslim Tweets This Morning","Just in case you needed any more proof that Donald Trump s racist tweets were a thinly-coded message to his alt-right, anti-Muslim, and white supremacist followers, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK has jumped on board today in praise of President Hates-a-Lot.It wasn t enough that the KKK endorsed Trump during his campaign to stop his multitudes of followers from voting for him, so it s hard to say whether Duke s full-throated endorsement of today s disgusting display of racism will be any different. But for the average American, seeing the former Klan leader get behind Trump so vigorously should make them more than a little sick.To even go to Duke s page on Twitter is to subject yourself to a blinding cover photo, all white, with a blue-eyed  Aryan  baby in the upper corner, and the words  It s Okay To Be White  across the middle. The phrase is part of a hate campaign that  Doctor  Duke has been pushing across America, a play on the notion that there is some kind of war on white people happening.But the tweet itself is disturbing:Trump retweets video of crippled white kid in Europe being beaten by migrants, and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death, He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T. Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 29, 2017By invoking God in his message, Duke is trying the age-old tactic of pretending that white supremacy has its roots in Christianity, an angle that KKK members have tried to use for generations.Sadly, it works on some followers of both Duke s and of Donald Trump s. It seems there s quite a bit of crossover between the two racist groups. That s no surprise: The KKK were absolutely instrumental in getting Trump elected.The bottom line is, both men know exactly what they re doing when they send messages like that to their followers. Trump s racist retweets were already disgraceful enough. But continuing to leave them on his Twitter feed even after seeing praise from a Loyal White Knight like David Duke is just rubbing salt in the wound.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images",News,"November 29, 2017"

He also complained about photos of himself that NBC used that he found unflattering.At one point, Trump turned to NBC News President Deborah Turness and told her the network won t run a nice picture of him, instead choosing  this picture of me,  as he made a face with a double chin.I hear Donald Trump really hates this photo. So make sure not to retweet it. Ever. pic.twitter.com/6dUnchk8tC  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) November 25, 2016#TrumpleChin is bad. Very weak. I have a tremendous chin.

While Hannity frequently calls liberals  snowflakes,  he continues to be the snowflakiest Fox News host on TV and on Twitter.Image via screen capture.",News,"November 28, 2017"
 Democrats Give Trump A Big F**ck You After He Attacks Them In Insane Twitter Rant,"Donald Trump s Twitter feed is always a goldmine of crazy. Unfortunately, since the orange overlord is now squatting in the Oval Office, those nutty tweets tend to have the ability to derail important policy initiatives, and can therefore have disastrous effects for the nation and sometimes the world. Case in point   the fact that he insisted upon attacking Democratic leaders that he had a meeting with regarding the debt ceiling, the Children s Health Insurance Program, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and other important domestic policy initiatives. Apparently, Trump saw fit to take to Twitter to accuse his old pals  Chuck and Nancy  of not being strong enough on crime and immigration, and therefore doesn t see a way to make deals with them:Meeting with  Chuck and Nancy  today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don t see a deal!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2017Given this out-of-the-blue attack, Democratic Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) released a joint statement promptly pulling out of the meeting, which reads: Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead. Leader Pelosi then took to Twitter herself to take Trump on:Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead.

 Trump Wakes Up To Scream At Black People After Hurling A Racial Slur Yesterday,"Donald Trump thinks if he rage-tweets about NFL players who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem as a form of silent protest against racial injustice and police brutality, it will all go away but by doing that, he inadvertently highlights that there is a problem. The former reality show star dropped a racial slur yesterday in front of Native American heroes, then today, he jumped on Twitter to yell at black people. We see a pattern here. At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up,  Trump screamed at the world.  The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control!

If he wants to talk about attendance, we can discuss his unenthusiastic inauguration crowd size. As for his ratings, he ranks as the least popular president in the history of polling.Donald Trump is actively trying to divide our country even more than it already is.

 Trump Supporters Object To Prince Harry’s Recent Engagement For Terrible Reasons (TWEETS),"Great Britain s Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that Prince Harry, the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales, had gotten engaged. A royal engagement is always big news in the United Kingdom, but this one also hit home in the United States too, because Harry s now-fiance is American actress Meghan Markle, best known for her roles as Rachel Zane in the legal drama series Suits, as well as special agent Amy Jessup in the sci-fi thriller Fringe.The British royal family no longer holds anywhere near as much clout as it once did, now essentially relegated to mere tabloid fodder, but while many were expressing their happiness online for one of the Windsor s most beloved members, quite a few Trump supporters expressed their dissatisfaction at the prince s choice. You see, Markle is biracial, her father being Caucasian and her mother African-American, and in the minds of many deplorables, this is a bad thing.It s completely irrelevant that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and husband of the reigning Queen Elizabeth II, is half-Greek, because that is pretty much white. However, when news broke of Prince Harry s engagement to Markle, white supremacists from across the United States and around the globe took to Twitter, because in their twisted minds, disturbing the racial purity of the British royal family is not a good thing, despite the fact the fact it has been going on for centuries. Here is but a mere sample:It's all smiles on TV but in private the #QUEEN is figuring out how to stop #PrinceHarry from destroying the #royalbloodline with mixed race #royalwedding #godsavethequeen $fb $twtr $goog #MAGA  $PENNY KING (@groman100) November 27, 2017Totally unsuitable as a Royal bride.

That s right, Prince Harry has made it quite clear that President Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding, despite the bride being a United States citizen. Barack and Michelle Obama, on the other hand, will more than likely be welcomed with open arms.Both Harry and especially his mother, Princess Diana, are well-known for their humanitarian work and according to a close source, the prince is  not a fan  of Trump.  Harry thinks the president is a serious threat to human rights,  the source continued, but there might be a lot more to it than just that.When Princess Diana split from her husband, Prince Charles, in 1992, a palace aide claims that Trump was  relentless  in his pursuit of Diana, a claim backed up by British TV journalist and friend of the princess, Selina Scott. Scott said that Trump bombarded Diana at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets of flowers,  adding that he gave Diana  the creeps,  a fact Trump representatives obviously deny. Then there were these tweets from Donald Trump when Princess Kate Middleton, wife of Harry s brother, Prince William, was illegally photographed by paparazzi sunbathing topless in her backyard in 2012:Kate Middleton is great but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude only herself to blame.

" While Honoring Native American Code Talkers, Trump Called Elizabeth Warren ‘Pocahontas’ (VIDEO)","Former reality show star Donald Trump just can t stop using a slur to describe Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) but this time he took things to the edge then crossed the line.

Trump was literally surrounded by Native Americans when he hurled the slur. The chief. He s the general and the chief,  Trump said during the White House event, in reference to White House chief of staff John Kelly.  I said, how good were these code talkers? He said, sir, you have no idea. You have no idea how great they were, what they have done for this country and the strength and the bravery and the love for the country. So that was the ultimate statement from General Kelly, the importance,  Trump continued.  And I just want to thank you because you re very, very special people.

 Pro-Trump Group Is Now Using Pictures Of An Obama Rally To Make Trump Look Popular,"In their pathetic attempt to pass the deeply unpopular and unfair tax bill that Republicans in Congress have been working on, the GOP has pulled out all the stops   and so have outside spending groups.Every campaign season, America is inundated with ad after ad claiming that one candidate or the other will be either the nation s savior or its downfall. But when ads start popping up for legislation, you know the party that s pushing it is desperate for support.America First Policies, a pro-Trump organization that calls itself a non-profit just because they legally can, has come up with a new ad intended to convince Americans to call their members of Congress and demand that they vote yes on the upcoming tax nightmare. We know it s a nightmare because the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office just scored the bill on Sunday night, and said that the legislation, which has had ZERO hearings, raises taxes on the poor, cuts taxes on the rich, and cripples Obamacare by repealing the individual mandate that makes the system function.The ad is a clever bit of doublespeak itself, as is everything that Republicans say when it comes to taxes. They have promoted the utterly debunked theory of  trickle-down  economics for more than three decades, and for all of their posturing, not a single dime of tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy has ever  trickled down  in the form of economic stimulus or higher pay for workers   as they perennially promise that it will.But it s an image that AFP uses in the ad that s catching people s attention.Watch the ad and see if you catch something that looks familiar:Check out our NEW TV ADThis is our once in a generation opportunity to CUT TAXES for the Middle Class.

 Breitbart Editor To CNN Host: A Song By Ringo Starr Proves Roy Moore Isn’t A Pedo (VIDEO),"A Breitbart News editor tried to use a song Ringo Starr covered in order to make claims appear to be false that controversial Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his thirties. On Monday, Breitbart editor Joel Pollak told host Chris Cuomo on CNN s  New Day  that Starr released  You re Sixteen (You re Beautiful, You re Mine),  a cover of a song that was actually written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman and performed by Johnny Burnette. The song was also featured in  American Graffiti. He was 30-something at the time singing about a 16-year-old,  Pollak said.  You want to take away Ringo Starr s achievement? You can t be serious,  Cuomo shot back.  I m dead serious. You think that Ringo Starr s song is supposed to be a nod toward allowing 30-year-olds to prey on teenagers? You don t believe that, Joel. You re a parent. You don t believe that.

He said it wasn t  accurate  to claim that the teenage girls were teenagers because one of them was 16 and the other was 18, both of which would be considered   wait for it   teenage years.Moore, by the way, has been accused of pursuing relationships with girls as young as 14-years-old when he was in his 30s. Moore was also banned from the Gadsden Mall and the YMCA for perving on teenage girls. A police officer was assigned to the job of making sure Moore stayed away from high school ballgames to be sure he didn t bother the cheerleaders.Someone should check Pollak s browsing history. Just a thought. In fact, check Donald Trump s, too, since he s come out strong in support of Roy Moore.Image via screen capture. ",News,"November 27, 2017"
 Former Obama Photographer Takes Trolling Trump To A Whole New Level (TWEETS),"By now you would most likely be familiar with the story of President Trump taking a pass at being named Time Magazine s Person of the Year, a rather prestigious honor that Trump has a bizarre fixation with and one that is highly unlikely to be bestowed upon him again any time in the near future following his nomination last year.For those of you not in the know, Donald Trump tried to claim on Friday that he turned down the chance to be selected as Time s  Person of the Year,  as he would be required to give an interview and do a photo shoot. Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named  Man (Person) of the Year,  like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot.

" Two Weeks Before Election, Trump Still Defends Accused Child Molester Because TAXES, Y’all","Sunday morning, after what must have seemed like another interminable weekend of scrutiny, terror, and being made to look like a fool, Donald Trump returned to doing what he does best: Being an absolute garbage person. He was still recovering from the humiliation of his hilariously bad attempt at pretending TIME Magazine  offered  him their Person of the Year honorific, followed by the embarrassment of trying to troll CNN, only to see their response tweet get twice the likes and retweets of his original.So Trump had to up his game. And how could he possibly piss off more people than by pivoting back to Roy Moore, the accused pedophile running for the US Senate in Alabama?Even some of Trump s most ardent supporters have begged the Doddering Dotard to back off his support for the toxic candidate. It s hard, as you might imagine, to truly get behind a guy who s accused of molesting young girls, especially with so much evidence against him. But Trump tried nonetheless:The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn t enough. Can t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017It s an interesting tack to take   just talking about how terrible Doug Jones is, rather than addressing the fact that Roy Moore is accused of touching children inappropriately. What s more interesting is how wrong he is on every count. Weak on crime? Jones successfully prosecuted the KKK members who blew up a Birmingham church, killing four young black girls in 1963. The Second Amendment? The most Jones supports as far as gun control is expanded background checks. Bad for the military? Jones supports increased military spending, a position that puts him at odds with the two lawmakers that Trump tries to  tie  Jones to in his tweets. Jones is largely considered a moderate among Democrats.The bottom line is, Trump is terrified of losing a crucial vote on his signature tax cuts for the wealthy. He is so calculating that if he didn t have something so important pending, he would throw Roy Moore under the bus in a heartbeat   despite the similarities between accusations against Moore and accusations against himself.This is the worst of politics, people. And when the Republican Party is bloodied on the floor of America, they can thank their garbage president who refused to back away from a child molester just because he wants to  accomplish  something before he s booted out of office.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 26, 2017"
 Principles Over Power: Why Republicans Need To Do What’s Right To Remain Relevant,"Over the last few weeks, I ve watched as the last shreds of the Republican Party s  family values  rotted away.As Alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in December they have two choices before them.They can vote for the Democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the Senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.In other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.They can t do both.And while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.Some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.Voting for Moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. It will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting Democrat for many years.If Republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to Moore and the people who defend him such as Donald Trump.This starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the GOP has lost. Perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the Nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the Southern Strategy ever did.And then the Republican Party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.America has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. Letting Moore step inside the Senate would send a message to the world that America supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.Such a message from the Republican Party smacks of hypocrisy. After all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton.But just like how they constantly bring up Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to claim that the Republican Party must still be great, their rhetoric about Bill Clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. The GOP is far removed from the days of Lincoln. And Bill Clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. The sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.However, by supporting Donald Trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, Republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their Bill Clinton talking point.If Moore wins next month, Republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. And the consequences will be severe.America is more diverse than ever before. Women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. Minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the GOP will no longer be able to be the party of white people. It just won t work.It s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the Republican Party.And that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.Sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. And that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate CEO or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.Republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.That s what Republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. Lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest Cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative Republicans and even a Democrat or two.And even though Lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Such a move at the time could have cost Lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.Lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. It s time for Republicans to do the same now.Seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how Republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.Today, I want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for Addicting Info.It has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years. I must first thank my readers for making this job possible. Knowing that I was informing so many people across the country and around the world motivated me to make writing about politics my career.

 Trump: Everything You Heard Me Say On The Access Hollywood Tape Never Happened,"Former reality show star Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to be held responsible for the words that come out of his own mouth, even when it s on tape. For example, the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which he suggests that because he s powerful, he can just grab women by their p-ssies. Trump defended sexual harasser and Fox News host (yeah, I know that s redundant) Bill O Reilly in the recent past and even more recently, he has defended alleged pedophile and Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. So, defending perverts is just another day for Donald Trump.Here s a quick reminder of what Trump said on the p*ssy grabbing tape: You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful [women]   I just start kissing them. It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. The New York Times reports that even after Trump made an almost-apology after the tape was revealed, he still told a Senator and an adviser that the Access Hollywood tape may not be authentic.But something deeper has been consuming Mr. Trump. He sees the calls for Mr. Moore to step aside as a version of the response to the now-famous  Access Hollywood  tape, in which he boasted about grabbing women s genitalia, and the flood of groping accusations against him that followed soon after. He suggested to a senator earlier this year that it was not authentic, and repeated that claim to an adviser more recently.So, to reiterate, Trump told an adviser recently that the video and tape of him talking about perving on women is fake news. And he also told that to a Senator after it was released.We see a pattern here. Maybe Trump s cult-like following will believe this crap but the rest of us remember that tape all too well. That tape was an indicating factor that Donald J. Trump is unfit for office, morally and intellectually.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 25, 2017"
 CNN BLISTERS Trump After He Attacks Them For Bad Representation: ‘That’s Your Job’ (TWEETS),"One of Donald Trump s favorite punching bags is CNN. He even once tweeted a GIF image of himself punching a person with a CNN logo superimposed over the head   indicating that he d like to enact violence against CNN s reporters. Then there was the time he tweeted the  Trump Train  roaring over  CNN.  Now, he s back at it   this time suggesting that  fake  CNN should be the ones representing America to the world, and that they are doing a bad job. Here is that tweet:.@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2017Of course, it is beneath the dignity of most people to respond to a moronic buffoon like Trump under normal circumstances. However, he is currently squatting in the White House, and has his tiny orange hands on the levers of power   not to mention the nuclear codes   so they have to stoop to a Trumpian level when personally attacked. However, being, well, you know, FIT to be doing the job they are doing, the good folks at CNN Communications fired back at Trump, and their response is nothing short of perfect:It's not CNN's job to represent the U.S to the world. That's yours. Our job is to report the news. #FactsFirst   CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 25, 2017BOOM! Couldn t have asked for a sicker burn than this. And they are right of course   especially the part about #FactsFirst. Trump has a problem with the truth, as we all well know.

" Gay GOP Operative Endorses Doug Jones Over ‘Bigoted, Deviant’ Roy Moore In Senate Race (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has a Roy Moore problem. Even before it came out that the judge turned Alabama Senate candidate is accused of being a child molester, he was a problem. He had been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for flagrantly defying the law. Moore has said Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He waved a gun around on stage at a campaign rally and rode a horse to the polls in Alabama to vote for himself in the primary he would eventually win against establishment-backed interim Senator Luther Strange. Well, it seems that with all of this and then some, sane Republicans have had enough of Roy Moore. One such person is former Jeb Bush campaign strategist Tim Miller. He  has a solution to his party s Roy Moore problem: Vote for the Democrat, Doug Jones, to keep Roy Moore the hell away from the United States Senate.Miller happens to be gay, so of course Moore s disgusting homophobia is a problem for him. Then there is, of course, the child molesting. In a column for the left-wing site Crooked Media entitled  The Republican Case for Doug Jones,  Miller says of his decision, which he calls,  obvious : But here we are in the dark abyss of 2017, and in this political moment, child exploitation attempted child rape, even has become a partisan issue. President Donald Trump is even cool with it, as long as the sex predator is on his team. A comrade in genital grabbing if you will. So after Trump essentially re-endorsed Alabama s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, this particular child predator, on Tuesday, I took what I thought was an obvious step. I donated to the other guy s campaign. But in this instance there was one wrinkle for me. The other guy, Doug Jones, is a Democrat. And I a Republican political operative have never donated to one of those before. Thus, in sharing the fact that I had made the donation on social media, I also noted that this was a first for me, even though it felt extremely obvious. Here is the tweet where Tim Miller announces his crossover:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well. Enough is enough. https://t.co/YlDXTXSnyJ  Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 21, 2017Tim Miller is right. Roy Moore is absolutely deplorable, and should be nowhere near the United States Senate. This isn t politics, it s morals. Now, it is time for more sane, reasonable Republicans to get out there and do the unthinkable   reject a child molester and endorse and donate to the man who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan while Roy Moore was busy creeping on little girls. It s not that hard.Watch the video of Tim Miller s appearance on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 23, 2017"
 WATCH: Retired Alabama Cop: We Were Told To Keep Roy Moore Away From High School Cheerleaders,"It seems that Republican candidate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions  vacated Senate seat Roy Moore s proclivity for teenage girls was well known decades ago in Gadsden, Alabama   even within the courthouse where he worked as an Assistant District Attorney, and even within the police department. Retired police officer Faye Gary spoke with MSNBC and said of the situation: The rumor mill was that he liked young girls, and   we were advised that he was being suspended from the mall because he would hang around the young girls that worked in the stores and   really got into a place of where they say he was harassing. We were also told to watch him at the ball games, and make sure that   he didn t hang around the cheerleaders. Faye Gary went on to say that she originally thought that Moore liked, perhaps, women in their 20 s   you know, LEGAL younger women. But, no. It was actually teenagers the old creep liked. Gary also said that Moore s liking for little girls   was a known fact,  while speaking with the New York Times, going on to say,  It was treated like a joke. That s just the way it was. Of course, Roy Moore has long been a controversial character. He was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice, both times refusing to follow the law. The first time it was over his refusal to removed a 5,000+ pound monument of the Ten Commandments from the Supreme Court building, and the second time for ordering officials around the state to refuse to comply with the United States Supreme Court s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality nation wide. He has also said that Representative Keith Ellison should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he is a Muslim. In other words, this is a man who has no regard for the rule of law, and is likely a child molester to boot.In short, the voters of Alabama need to reject this bigoted extremist, and, if they don t, they ll be sending a message to the rest of the nation: a child molester is much better to be seated in the Senate than a Democrat.Watch Faye Gary s comments on the matter below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2017"
 New York Times Reports There’s An Actual Russian Agent In Congress And He Has A Code Name,"More than a year ago, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was caught *oops* on a hot mic saying that there were two people in Washington who were being paid by the Russians   Donald Trump and California GOP. Rep Dana Rohrabacher. Sadly, those two people are still in office.A new report by the New York Times, though, confirms half of McCarthy s comments. Rohrabacher isn t just being paid by the Russians, he s a Russian agent, and he has a code name, and it s not even new information.According to the Times report, the FBI warned Rohrbacher in 2012 that the Russians viewed him as a source and had given him a code name. The next year, Congress elevated him to the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee that overseas Russian policy. Nope, nothing at all fishy there.Rohrabacher didn t seem to have much involvement in the Trump campaign (that would be too obvious, even for the Russians), but Special Investigator Robert Mueller is eyeing him nonetheless:As revelations of Russia s campaign to influence American politics consume Washington, Mr. Rohrabacher, 70, who had no known role in the Trump election campaign, has come under political and investigative scrutiny. The F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee are each seeking to interview him about an August meeting with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Rohrabacher said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump s short-lived national security adviser.Rohrabacher s Russian connections go back further than just a few years, though. As a young Reaganite, he got the warm fuzzies with the fall of the Soviet Union and he developed a relationship with Vladimir Putin. In the 90s, Rohrabacher lost an arm wrestling match to the man who would become President for life, or whatever the hell Putin calls himself.Rohrabacher, naturally, denies that he is a Russian agent:Mr. Rohrabacher has laughed off suggestions that he is a Russian asset, and said in an interview that he did not remember being briefed that the Russians viewed him as a source. The F.B.I. and the senior members of the House Intelligence Committee sat Mr. Rohrabacher down in the Capitol in 2012 to warn him that Russian spies were trying to recruit him, according to two former intelligence officials. I remember them telling me,  You have been targeted to be recruited as an agent,  he said.  How stupid is that? Only, his actions paint a very different picture. In 2016, he served as what might be called a delivery boy between Russia and either the Trump campaign or the RNC. He picked up a memo targeting Democratic donors. Rohrabacher has also met with Wikileaks  Julian Assange and Russian (accused criminal) oligarchs.Rohrabacher insists nothing untoward is going on. His goal, he says, is to bring Russia in to help us battle terrorism. To be fair, Russia could help rein in terrorism, but they would have to stop funding terrorists, like Syrian President Bashir Assad.Republicans are finding it a bit easier to distance themselves from Rohrabacher than the other alleged Russian agent, Donald Trump. They are limiting his power on the Foreign Affairs committee.Politically, this could be disaster for Rohrabacher. He s facing a tough race in California, and you d better believe that his opponents are using his Russian connections against him.Hans Keirstead, a prominent stem-cell researcher competing with five other Democrats to challenge Mr. Rohrabacher, compared the Republican s Russia record to  a prologue to a very bad book. We ve got a Russian-tainted congressman,  Mr. Keirstead said in an interview, adding  Why should the constituents of the 48th District vote for an individual whose interests are elsewhere? Of course, Rohrabacher, like anyone who s been trained in dictator 101, is fundraising off of it, calling it an  attack. Featured image via Adam Berry/Getty Images.",News,"November 22, 2017"
