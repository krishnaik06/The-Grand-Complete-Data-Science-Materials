# 📊 Heart Disease Prediction Using ML and DL

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple **classification models** on a structured dataset using a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline**. The objective was to achieve **strong generalization performance** while maintaining model interpretability and robustness.

Several classical and advanced machine learning algorithms were implemented, evaluated, and compared. Although **ensemble techniques were explored**, they were **not included in the final solution** due to degraded validation performance.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

The following classification algorithms were trained and evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* AdaBoost Classifier
* XGBoost Classifier
* CatBoost Classifier
* LightGBM Classifier

Each model was tuned with reasonable hyperparameters and evaluated using consistent metrics.

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Pipeline

The dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:

1. Handling missing values
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Feature scaling using **StandardScaler** (for numerical features)
4. Train-test split with index alignment preserved

All preprocessing steps were applied **only on training data** and then transformed on test data to avoid data leakage.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

The final model was selected based on **overall generalization performance**, not just training accuracy. **Random Forest** gave the best performace.

---

## 🏆 Final Model Selection

After comparative evaluation, the best-performing model was selected based on:

* Strong validation/test metrics
* Stable performance across folds
* Lower overfitting tendency
* Interpretability 

---

## 🧪 Reproducibility

To ensure reproducibility:

* Random seeds (`random_state`) were fixed
* Consistent preprocessing and evaluation strategy was followed
