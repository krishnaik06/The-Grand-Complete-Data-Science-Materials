In this project we will explain how to create your own dataset using your own image to identify your face.

create a data folder > which includes images, ( actual images)
HOW TO TAKE PICTTURES OF YOURSELF?  Don't worry I've added a snippet to take your own pictures for every 3 secs.

and divide them in to 4 parts and add them in these folders as shown (labels, test, train, val)
using Image annotation, Manually Annotate your image and split them into Train, test, and Val.

[In this we have divided and added train and test data as 70% and 30%]

later Load a Test Image and Annotation with OpenCV and JSON, later we Extract the co-ordinates and resize the images. Using augmentation we will increase 3X of your images,

furthermore, we'll Build and Run Augmentaion Pipeline, loading to ensorflow dataset.
Combining labels and image samples. check the loss functions and Train your neural network to detect Face and predict and That's it,

Now you are all set to use the Annoatted, trained Face detection application, and all set.
