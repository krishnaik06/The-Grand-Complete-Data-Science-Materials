## About The Project

Welcome to the Flight Fare Prediction App! This project aims to provide users with a tool to predict flight fares based on various parameters, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking air travel. The app utilizes machine learning algorithms trained on historical flight data to estimate future fares. Users can input details such as departure and arrival locations, date, and airline preferences to receive an estimated fare for their desired flight. Whether you're a frequent traveller or planning your next vacation, this app is designed to make the flight booking process more transparent and efficient. Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the functionality of this Flight Fare Prediction App!
