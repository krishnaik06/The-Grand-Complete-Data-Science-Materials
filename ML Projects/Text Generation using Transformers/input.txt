Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?  You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .  What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .  Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?  I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .  I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .  That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .  Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too .  Good.Let ' s go now .  All right . Can you do push-ups ?  Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute .  Really ? I think that's impossible !  You mean 30 push-ups ?  Yeah !  It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . Can you study with the radio on ?  No , I listen to background music .  What is the difference ?  The radio has too many comerials .  That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . Are you all right ?  I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire .  Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。  I see . Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?  Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates .  What position do you play ?  I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .  Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself .  Oh , yeah ? Which team ?  The Rockets .  Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later .  All right , see you later . Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?  I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !  What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?  It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?  January 5th .  Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !  That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .  No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .  Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?  A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?  Is he really ?  Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .  Who is he marring ?  A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .  Have they set a date for the wedding ?  Not yet . I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs .  That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market .  What kind of house is it ?  It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style .  Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses .  And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price .  Great , is it a two bedroom house ?  No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage .  That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you .  Yeas , when will you buy a house ?  Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding .  Right , congratulations .  Thank you . Hi , Becky , what's up ?  Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .  What's the problem ?  She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around .  For example ?  Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .  No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .  It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .  My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .  You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?  We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .  That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . How are Zina's new programmers working out ?  I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius .  So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ?  It'll be close , but we'll make it .  Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore .  And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . Do you like cooking ?  Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold .  Why do you like it ?  I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food .  That's wonderful !  And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too .  Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me .  Certainly . Anyone home ? Jen !  I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in !  Wow ! You're really working up a storm !  I know . I've even worked up a sweat .  You look like a cooking show host--only messier . You look so tan and healthy !  Thanks . I just got back from summer camp .  How was it ?  Great . I got to try so many things for the first time .  Like what ?  I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding .  I ’ m so jealous .  The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?  It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume .  I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that .  That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . Ah , ah , ah ...  All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .  Jog ?  Then , you are to walk to work .  Walk ?  Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .  Oh no .  Use the stairs , never the elevator .  Oh , dear .  And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .  Oh no .  OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class .  Dance class ! I don't know how .  You will .  Oh ... Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .  Oh where was that ?  I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .  Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .  Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ?  She will be 86 next month .  That is truly amazing ! I would like to register for a class today .  No problem , what class would you like to take ?  I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy .  There are two classes that are still open .  Which days are these classes on ?  The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three .  What about the other class ?  The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12 .  Are you sure there are no more open classes ?  I'm positive .  Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday .  Okay , I'll sign you up . Dad , why are you taping the windows ?  Honey , a typhoon is coming .  Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow .  Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food .  OK . Dad ! I'm coming . Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia .  Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .  To me English is a difficult language .  A second language is always difficult .  True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language .  A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?  One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .  No wonder you say English is a crazy language . Can I help you ?  I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look .  I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?  My paper is on the influence of television on children .  There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .  Thank you for you help . Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?  Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run .  What ’ s the score ?  Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base .  So Baltimore is winning ?  Right .  This is a really great place to watch a baseball game .  Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place .  The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia .  It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game .  Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . How do you like the pizza here ?  Perfect . It really hits the spot . Do you have a light ?  Sorry , I don't smoke . I was scared stiff of giving my first performance .  Were you ? your performance was excellent .  Thank you for your kindly words . Excuse me . Could you please take a picture of us with this camera ?  Sure . Which button do I press to shoot ?  This one .  Do I have to focus it ?  No , this is a focus-free camera . All you have to do is point and press the button .  All right . Say cheese ! Every country should face the history .  Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history .  Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first .  But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history .  I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . Do you like traveling , Kathy ?  I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ...  Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving .  Exactly . Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one .  I do wish I could afford one .  You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases .  Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? How do you do , Prof.Smith .  How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English .  Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child .  Where did you learn it ?  At school , in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country .  It's amazing . Do you want black or white coffee ?  White , please  Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ?  I don't like Folk music very much .  What kind of music do you like ?  I like classical music . Do you ?  Not very much . Classical music sends me to sleep  I don't believe you .  It ’ s true .  You are funny !  So are you ! How about another coffee ? What do you like to do in your spare time ?  I like playing chess .  Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?  I'm afraid not .  Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?  Oh , yes . I like playing basketball .  Can you tell me why you like it ?  Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others . Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere .  Haven't you heard that he is in prison ?  What ? Beg your pardon .  John is in prison now . He was copped outstealing .  I just cann't believe my ears ! Can I help you ?  I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look .  I'll certainly try to help you.What topic is your paper on ?  My paper is on the influence of television on children .  There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .  Thank you for you help . Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ?  Well , I have the day off from work .  That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ?  Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy .  Sounds nice .  Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies .  Can I stop by ?  Sure . Any time . You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ?  Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ?  I don ’ t think you ’ re right there .  I believe industry is making us wealthier .  I don ’ t believe that .  And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier .  I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ?  I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago .  That ’ s your opinion not mine . What do you plan to do for your birthday ?  I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum .  How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it .  OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . How may I help you ?  I would like to return this book .  Is that all you need ?  I also want to check out this video .  Is that all you would like to check out ?  That ’ s all I need .  Do you have your library card ?  Here it is .  Make sure to take proper care of this video .  That won ’ t be a problem .  If you damage the video , you will be fined .  I won ’ t damage it . What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable .  It's us .  What do you mean by us .  Well , you always say you're busy .  That's right .  And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .  I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me .  Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it .  You mean I am groaned a few words ?  Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . Hi , Mary . You look pale today . What's the matter with you ?  I think I've caught a cold . Now I'm aching all over .  You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest . I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon .  Thank you . I suppose I should go to see a doctor . I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .  Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .  How about the new bar across road ?  Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too .  I agree , I had lunch there last week .  excellent ! That sounds like a plan . Could you tell me the right time , please ?  Well . My watch says five past two . But it ’ s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days .  You have to go and fix it .  Yes . I will . does your family have a record of your ancestors ?  sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it .  do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it .  I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far .  that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ?  I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side .  are you very close to your first-cousins ?  the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones .  I see . who ’ s the head of your household ?  it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family .  that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ?  at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother .  that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ?  Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ?  How about tomorrow afternoon ?  Sure . Where shall I meet you ?  At the gate of the park .  Great . I look forward to meeting you .  See you then .  See you . I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ?  Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team .  Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ?  Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration .  Could you move smoothly ?  Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind .  What happened afterwards ?  I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was .  Poor girl ! You look pale recently .  Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have tobe wrapped upon my work .  Take good care of yourself .  Thank you . I will . Hey , Maggy , Did you hear about David ?  About David ? No , I didn ’ t hear anything .  You know , about David and his new boss .  Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you .  Well , I heard David has been fired .  Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . how do you usually get to school ?  I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ?  I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car .  I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution !  I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient .  cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment .  do you have a car ?  no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it .  maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it .  you could try . It would save you a lot of money .  that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .  if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !  I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere !  let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .  sounds good ! Let's go ! What's wrong with him ?  His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ?  Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot .  You are going to take courses ?  Yes . I am going to take some university courses there .  Sounds hard .  Yes , but I think it's probably for the best .  Won ’ t you get lonely ?  Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ?  Well , do you think I have to ?  I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days .  Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon .  Good.So we don't have to work.How nice !  But I don't think it's so nice .  Why ?  The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week .  Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . On , darn . The grocery store is closed .  Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth .  Alright . We are out of everything .  I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day .  I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home .  Yeah , and the prices there are very high .  I know . Three dollars for milk . Do you think they two will get married ?  You can count on it .  I think so.Yes , they get along so well .  I like him.He ' s good for her .  You're right . He sure is . Dad , where are we off to ?  First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum .  Where are we going to have a drink ?  There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ?  Yes ?  That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank .  Good . I will have hot chocolate .  A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green .  When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you .  Sorry . How far is the museum ?  I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop .  Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . How about going to the cinema tonight ?  That's great . What's on tonight ?  I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .  Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .  Don't you think it's too bloody ?  On the contrary , very exciting . I feel so uncomfortable .  Are you sick ?  No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge .  He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo .  Really ? Are you sure ?  Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .  Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot !  Really ?  Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink .  Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something .  I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic .  Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ?  It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now .  Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ?  News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on .  Is there anything interesting ?  Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education .  I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ?  Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .  That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ?  Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .  I got it . Do you pay for the programs ?  Yes , 50 Yuan per month . Oh , no !  How dreadful !  Look at the view from the window .  Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected .  It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ?  I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed .  It can ’ t be helped . What do you do in your free time , Nancy ?  Well , I like playing the violin .  Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ?  About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school .  That's really interesting .  Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?  Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though .  Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . How can I tell her about this ?  Don't worry , you'll find a way .  There is no need to be so frustrated .  How can you live without job in the future ?  Don't worry , you'll find a way . What sports do you like to play ?  I like baseball and basketball .  How about football ?  In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger .  It's a very popular game in America .  Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ?  For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .  Are you a football player ?  No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football .  What is two hand touch and flag football ?  Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .  I see . It's safer then right ?  Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us .  I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together .  Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning .  Great . What upsets you ?  My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date .  It is not your mother finding one for you ?  I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl .  Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type .  You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea .  No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes .  I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time .  I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight .  Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that .  Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .  I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . Are you going to the party on Saturday ?  I was thinking about it . Are you ?  Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun .  Really ? Well , what time does it start ?  It starts at 8  Well , who all is going to be there ?  Everyone from school .  How do you know it's going to be so fun ?  This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks .  Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun .  So am I going to see you at the party ?  Yeah , I will be there . Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ?  Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ?  Am I failing ?  Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ?  I am pretty sure that I am in trouble .  I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ?  I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis .  Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ?  I'll try ; it's hard !  Thanks for stopping by ! Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you !  Thanks . I'll never ever work together with him !  What happened ? Quarrel again ?  Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please !  Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !  What ? What did you buy ?  It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?  There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .  And ?  So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .  And it's a brick ?  Yes .  I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?  I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .  So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .  Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .  But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?  He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .  Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !  C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .  That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .  You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? Is the clock right ?  I'm afraid it gains a little .  By how many minutes ?  Two . Hey , Mary , what's up ?  Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight .  Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ?  Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .  It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?  There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends .  Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty .  I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .  Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good .  Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer !  I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .  Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe .  A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me .  It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff .  Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says .  Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?  There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !  Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?  Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ?  I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning  Does that mean studying all the time ?  I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors .  Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer .  You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts  Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active .  Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things .  You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French .  Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France .  Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . How old are you ?  Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ?  I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th .  Are you going to have a birthday party ?  Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . It smells like an ashtray in here !  Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?  What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .  No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !  Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before .  I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?  Fine ! I want a divorce ! Why are you shivering ?  It's freezing . It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy .  I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him .  How come you think of him that way ?  Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out .  I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm .  Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ?  Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy .  All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard .  I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ?  Sure , I have . Will you join ?  I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .  You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking .  I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there .  No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that .  Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow .  I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ?  The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily .  He is cute.What dose he do ?  I'm not sure , he is a manager I think .  Really ? Are you going to introduce us ?  Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . You didn't ring me last night . You said you would .  I'm sorry to have made you disappointed .  That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch .  Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize .  And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?  Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ?  Yes , I did . But I feel tired today .  Really ? Why ?  Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country .  And I bet you studied , too .  Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ?  Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV .  That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ?  Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend .  What's the route ?  From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank .  If only I could join it ! Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books .  Oh , dear .  You must have realized somebody was here .  Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ?  I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?  About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .  I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .  Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .  Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .  How ’ s your son these days ?  Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .  He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?  I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .  Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .  Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?  Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .  Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .  It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . I'm going to Japan this year on vacation .  Have you ever been to America ?  No , but I'd really like to .  You'd like it . Hey , Mark , long time no see .  Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ?  Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand .  Really ? How was it ?  Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back .  I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful .  They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap .  I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ?  Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing .  I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself .  Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ?  Yeah , it sure would . Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make .  Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?  Did you have the room checked before we move in ?  Which room are you in ?  1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower .  I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again .  Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win !  You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ?  Not only that !  Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? !  OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone !  What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us .  I'm very sorry I can't .  Why not ?  I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ?  Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired .  I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job .  I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful !  You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices .  That's right , I have to work hard . The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ?  Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ?  Certainly . Excuse me , is this seat taken ?  No , please feel free .  Thanks a lot .  Do you work in Shanghai ?  Yes I do . How about you ?  No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here .  You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ?  Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure !  Uh huh ... Look at this headline , Soo Mi .  Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced !  Is it the same in Korea ?  I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together .  Do people get married young ?  Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 .  Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ?  No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight .  The beauty under the tree ?  Of course.No girl is more charming .  She is a young man ! Excuse me.Where do I register ?  Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion .  Is that the large , white building ?  Yeah , that's it .  Thanks . How was your education going on in Australia ?  I'm going to graduate this summer .  Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ?  I'm planning to return to China after graduation .  Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .  Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .  Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ?  Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite .  I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ?  I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating .  You won't play online games full of violence , will you ?  Once in a while .  It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful .  I hope I can practice self-control again . What ’ s the plot of your new movie ?  It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th  Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .  I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no  Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ?  Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think .  Did you do you own stunts in the movie ?  I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future .  Thank you very much for doing this interview .  My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ?  Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . Who's that old lady trimming the trees ?  She's my grandma .  She's looks very healthy.How old is she ?  92 . Mom . My legs are killing me .  Hold on . We will be successful right away . Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing !  I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now !  Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ...  What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! What did you say ?  I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ?  Well , I feel a little tired .  Come on ! A little labor , much health .  Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter .  Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather .  I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?  I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ?  Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job !  I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ...  Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ?  Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven .  I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ?  As long as it doesn't take too long .  My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him .  Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?  He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't .  So what's the problem ? Mary , how was your date with john ?  it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common .  oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ?  he is tall and slim , fair-haired .  sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?  he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .  oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ?  he didn't say , but he said he would call me .  maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much !  oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ?  come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry .  thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging .  that's what friends are for . Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?  It was a nightmare .  What ’ s up ?  Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .  Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?  Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .  This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?  I am still waiting for their call .  Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ?  Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it .  Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while .  You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit .  That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . Which pair of jeans do you like best ?  I really like the straight legs .  But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ?  I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them .  That's the style ! You just wear boxers .  What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ?  You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants !  If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! Hi , Charles . What's the matter ?  Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck .  Do you have a ride home ?  Yes , my wife is coming to get me .  That's good . Do you live near here ?  No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ?  I live downtown , with my parents .  Do you have a car ?  I don't need a car . I walk to work .  You're lucky ! Happy anniversary , sweetheart !  Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers !  I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering .  Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing .  That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song .  I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ?  Always . What do you plan to do for your birthday ?  I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum .  How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it .  OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . How about seconds , Victor ?  No.thanks . I'm full . Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?  I'd love to .  Let's say about 6:00 ?  That's OK with me . Cigarette ?  Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ?  Sorry , here .  Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty .  I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do .  Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ?  Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour .  Well , Rose .  Is there something any need ?  Are your free this weekend ?  Yes , I have nothing to do .  Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ?  I beg your pardon ?  I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat .  Really ? well , ok , you're welcome .  Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ?  Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner .  Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine .  OK . Then I'll be expecting you .  I'll be there on time . How do you shoot pool ?  You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball .  And ?  You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets .  How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ?  At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set .  Can I get the black ball in ?  The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets .  Let's go and try now ! How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ?  I'd enjoy that .  I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .  OK . I'll see you then . The mosquitos are biting me !  Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks .  Do you have any bug spray ?  No , I forgot to buy some .  Then we ’ ll have to put up with it .  We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep .  That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it !  Run ! They are thirsty for more ! Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ?  I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program .  Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that .  Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all .  All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram .  Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want .  That's exactly what I want , thank you . Okay , can I ask you something direct ?  Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush .  Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ?  No , seriously . . . I really want this .  I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 .  I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down .  I guess so . My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay .  It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do .  But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ?  It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment .  What time is the right moment ?  Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . Please excuse me , but I really have to be going .  Yes , of course.It was nice to see you .  It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . Excuse me . Is this seat taken ?  I'm afraid so . What do you think of the coming match ?  Winning is a piece of cake to me .  You are bragging again . What would you reckon the taxing increases ?  Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose .  But what do most people think about it ?  Ah , it ’ s hard to say . are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?  of course . Is the dinner still on ?  yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .  we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .  that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .  it can't be that bad .  I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .  really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .  do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better .  ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ?  when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation .  has anything else happened to you ?  nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .  well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .  Why doesn't he ask her ?  He is too scared to ask her .  He's a chicken guy . I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit .  Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy .  If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that .  She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere .  Haven't you heard that he is in prison ?  What ? Beg your pardon .  John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing .  I just cann't believe my ears ! What do you need ?  I need to use the Internet .  You have your library card , right ?  Yes , I do .  There is a wait right now to use the computers .  That ’ s fine .  Would you please write your name on this list ?  Then what ?  I will call you when a computer is free .  How do I log on to the computer ?  Use the number on the back of your library card .  Thanks . I ’ ll be sitting over there . What a nice tie you are wearing !  Thank you.But does it really look all right ?  Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly .  Then does it go well with my sweater ?  Yes.You look very smart today .  Thank you very much . What do you make of the case ?  If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty .  What do you mean by saying so ?  I mean it ’ s not his fault .  Oh , yeah ?  Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? Happy Mother's Day , Mom !  Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have !  Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us .  I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . I have a real problem when I meet people .  What is it ? Maybe I can help .  I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ?  Do you come from a country where they shake hands ?  Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time .  It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t .  But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too .  Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do .  That sounds easy enough .  Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it .  Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well .  Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out .  Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us .  Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ?  The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one .  Oh , no .  Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ...  I would think this was the least they could do .  In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while .  Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away .  I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at .  Let's go in to wait for them .  After you . When do you usually go to the movies ?  I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ?  The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week .  That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . Are you telling us a lie again ?  I will be hanged if I lying .  All right . But what was the trouble ?  My car run out of petrol . I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ?  He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .  Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte .  When did you start worrying about your weight ?  I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ?  No , Jess , chill out ! Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes .  We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon .  Two tickets , please . How much are they ?  Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist .  I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper .  Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama .  Are these seats okay ?  They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . Do you often buy magazines ?  I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments .  Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ?  Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes .  Do you have an online edition of that magazine ?  Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription .  Do you have a subscription ?  Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ?  I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue .  It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way .  Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you .  I'm sorry . What's your name again ?  Barbara . But please , just call me Barb .  So Barb ... what do you do ?  I'm studying medicine .  Really ? Where ?  At Harvard . What about you ?  I'm an engineer at IBM .  Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting .  Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready .  Good . I'm starving . Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here !  What are you so excited about ?  I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art !  What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman .  I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person .  There are tons of other paintings that I think are better .  Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ?  No , how much is it worth ?  About 80 million dollars .  Whoa . hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?  part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?  oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?  sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender .  cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !  yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .  that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?  of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .  you mean you got working experience , right ?  not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .  it must be very demanding .  sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out .  really ? It sounds interesting .  maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around .  great . I ’ m looking forward to it . Have you seen that house ?  Yes , it looks interesting .  You're right . I love it very much .  It must be old .  At least more than 100 years old .  Let's enter it !  I can't open the door .  It must be locked .  Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .  She can't answer you .  She must be deaf .  It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?  Frightened ? You must be joking . Have you got any hobbies ?  Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards .  Which is easier to learn ?  Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . Jim , how was your weekend ?  I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there .  That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ?  Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go .  I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation .  It sure is .  I can ’ t wait to go there myself . You'd better prepare for the examination .  I don't think the exam will be very hard .  You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course .  Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists .  I did , but he gives me a runaround .  If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table .  But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . What is the correct time , please ?  It's exactly twelve minutes past seven .  When will the lecture begin ?  It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . Should I ask Sara to the party ?  I would if I were you . If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word .  You said it . I always count on him when I need his help .  Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ?  What is a sixties party ?  You come dressed in anything from the sixties .  That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ?  Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something .  Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ?  That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ?  Don't tell me you have a record player ! I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad .  Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient .  I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better .  A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress .  Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day .  Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !  My first grandchild .  And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does .  Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though .  Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does .  Well , children usually resemble their parents .  It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is .  You often like comparing children with their parents .  You ’ re right . The music has started .  How do you like this waltz ?  It's very nice .  May I ask you for a dance ?  Certainly .  You are doing the waltz wonderfully well .  Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?  Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .  I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?  Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .  It must be interesting to study English .  Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .  Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?  Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !  What is it ? What happened ?  I think someone is stalking me .  No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?  I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .  What did you do ?  I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .  Did he leave when you left ?  Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .  What did you do ?  He followed me all the way home !  That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .  Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?  Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .  Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !  Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .  I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .  Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .  Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?  I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?  I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .  Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .  Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .  But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?  Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .  I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?  That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .  Really ?  Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .  Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?  Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .  How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?  That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .  So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?  Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .  Why did they want to found a college ?  Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .  Oh , I see .  Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .  When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?  In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .  It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .  Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .  Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .  Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .  I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .  Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .  That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .  You can ask me any question at any time . I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ?  Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us .  I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock .  But I have an appointment with Ann .  Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . What do you do in summer ?  I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ?  I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book .  What do you do in winter ?  Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter .  I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter .  Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !  Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ?  Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover .  I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying .  I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget .  But I think time can change everything . Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ?  Pardon ?  What university would you enter ?  University ? Why ? You asked me last year .  Oh , I forget.Sorry .  I went to Harvard University .  Did you ? And what course did you take there ?  God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ?  I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory .  I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ?  Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion .  Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ?  Yep . And I should start planning now .  Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ?  Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone .  How Ay days will the reunion be ?  Usually it's at least five days and four nights .  This is going to be a major production for you ! Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia .  Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .  To me English is a difficult language .  A second language is always difficult .  True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language .  A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?  One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .  No wonder you say English is a crazy language . What did you think of the film ?  I liked it . I thought it was great .  Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ?  Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ?  Not really . I thought it was disappointing .  It's a nice cinema , isn't it ?  Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good .  Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer !  I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .  Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe .  A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me .  It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff .  Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says .  Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?  There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !  Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?  Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? Which film shall we see ?  There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ?  Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ?  Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ?  No , I'm not hungry .  Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ?  I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts .  Wow , you sound very professional .  I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . Can I borrow your suit ?  That's out of the question . Bill , how can you hear so happy today ?  Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today .  Really ? What was the matter ?  You knew Brain Locker ?  Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ?  Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses .  Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . Where are you from ?  I'm from Guangzhou .  Where in China is Guangzhou ?  It's in the South of China . Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six .  In that case , I won ’ t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime .  Ok , Goodbye .  See you later . Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students !  Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester .  That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian ,  That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o  Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture .  I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes .  Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .  I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese .  Well , there is that , yes . Hey , I'm hungry . How about you ?  Yeah , I can really go for some Chinese food right now .  That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant .  I know one . Let's go . Good morning , Miss Li .  Morning , Mike .  I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday .  I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ?  I feel much better now .  Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?  I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks .  I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ?  I will . Do you like flowers ?  Of course , I like .  What's your favorite flower ?  Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival .  Spring is a lively season .  Yes . How about you ?  I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter .  You have a perfect taste !  It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms .  But it used to be ignored by many people .  The bright people will remember it forever .  Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . What is the weather like today ?  It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind .  And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ?  I missed today's weather for cast in the radio  It seems 10 degree below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery .  The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport  That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . What kind of music do you like listening to ?  I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?  Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work .  I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .  Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .  Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .  Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework .  I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power .  You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .  That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier .  That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street .  I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish .  That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ?  No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop .  What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ?  Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least .  That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion .  Let's try it ! Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon .  Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby .  Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday .  Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own .  In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese .  Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?  It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now .  Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? Well , I am a regular member of this club .  Do you have to pay to join ?  Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars .  Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ?  Very few , unfortunately .  How was your game today ?  Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies !  Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ?  Ten . How did your game go ?  My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps .  Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . The concert was really great .  I agree .  The singing group used to be very popular .  I can't believe they would play so good . I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ?  Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ?  It's at 8: 00 .  That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ?  Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late .  Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 .  That sounds fine . Is the Chinese team taking the lead ?  No , it's the Japanese team .  Japanese teams always play a dark horse .  Well , their team work is well worth learning . Do you mind if I ask your friend out ?  Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends .  Okay , that's good .  Do you want me to put in a good word for you ? Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone .  I know only too well what that's like .  What do you mean ?  I was very sad when I was laid off last year . Hi , Is that David ?  Hi , Jenny . It's David here .  Hey , what's new ?  Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me .  Sorry to hear that . What happened ?  Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue .  Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday .  What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser .  Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her .  But she lied to me .  Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ?  Ok , then .  But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face .  What face ?  The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better .  Yeah , I know . You are right . This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ?  A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive .  Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast .  Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly .  Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ?  Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks .  Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car .  Cut out , would you ? When's your birthday ?  It's just around the corner . Bob is getting on in years .  Yeah , I'm very worried about his health .  He looks tired all the time .  He's working too hard . Which church do you attend ?  I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .  What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ?  Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church .  Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ?  That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all .  Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ?  Yes .  Why do you really go to church ?  We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic .  That's okay . Better late than never . Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?  Hello ! I was exhausted some studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet .  People are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .  You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .  There must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .  Well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?  Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .  Well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment .  I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .  I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair !  Don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . Hi ! Tom . Want to go to play bowling tonight ?  Sounds good . When and where shall we meet ?  Let me see . How about 6:30 at the gate of the club ?  Fine , see you then . Are there many idioms in English ?  There are hundreds and hundreds.English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .  Can you give us an example ?  I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information .  What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ?  That is just a natural , grammatical English expression.It has a direct translation in other languages .  This is interesting , Ms.Parker . Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?  Because Myra was cheating on exams , and she spoke back rudely .  I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . Do you know where I can park ?  Do you need a spot here or off campus ?  I want a space on campus .  There's a parking structure for students .  Where can I find it ?  Go to the western side of the campus , and you'll find it there .  Is it full ?  When I went up there , it wasn't full at all .  When was that ?  Sometime this morning .  Would it be full now ?  I am really not sure . Have you heard of the Love Bug ?  Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ?  Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year .  This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ?  Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it .  So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick . I am confused by what he said .  Why do you say that ?  I don ’ t know what he wants to do . Does he want help me or just scold me ?  Think a little . I think he means well at the bottom of his heart . Where are you going ?  I ’ m going to the hospital .  What ’ s the matter ?  Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident .  That ’ s too bad . How are things now ?  His life is hanging by a thread , and he is under an emergency treatment . Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ?  Sorry , I can't . I am busy .  What are you doing ?  I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month .  What kind of volunteer work ?  I help out at the children's hospital . I help plan activities .  Oh , yeah ?  Yes , it ’ s exciting . This month we are doing crossword puzzles . Are the children all grown up now , Rose ?  Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer .  Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading .  She ’ s a librarian at the public library .  Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl .  Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer .  Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ?  Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him .  Really ? Where does he live now ?  Colorado .  And does Rocky drive a truck , too ?  Oh , no . Rocky is a pilot .  Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ?  Yes . Mostly to England and France . Merry Christmas , Linda !  Merry Christmas , Lee !  Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it .  Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it . Where's your better half ?  She's at home . Look , there are some words on the fish .  I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays .  For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ?  Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic .  You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people .  Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal .  Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ?  OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? Who's singing in your home , Jim ?  It's Ellie and her friends .  Who's Ellie ?  She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing " Happy Birthday " .  Oh , I see.how old is she ?  She's ten .  I suppose they're playing games .  Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ?  Today .  Today ?  Yes .  Well , imagine that ! How old are you ?  Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ?  Very much.What time ?  About 6:00 .  I'll be at your house at about 5:30 . Happy birthday . Well , it was nice meeting you .  Yes , I hope we meet again .  Sure , I'll give you a call .  Okay . I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people .  And what did the program say ?  It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier .  I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea .  And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .  And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders .  Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again !  We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !  not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black .  The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .  I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field .  Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .  Let's hope it is ! What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand .  It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm .  Such a thing exists ?  Fortunately , yes . You're blushing !  Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast .  You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... Did you get any rewards or honors in college ?  Yes , I received the scholarship 3 times on end .  Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) ?  Yes , I joined the CPC when I was a freshman Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much .  Let ’ s go for a joy ride . Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season .  Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ?  Manchester United . What about you ?  Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ?  I have confidence in them . The weekend's finally here !  And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that .  Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow .  Sounds good . What do we need to bring ?  We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad .  I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan . Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning .  What ’ s up ?  I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow .  America ? Did you get admit to MIT ?  Yes .  Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you .  Thank you .  Really going to miss you .  Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call .  Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey .  Thank you .  Look after yourself . Bye .  Bye . You know , Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days .  And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves .  But you're not to blame for them keeping him there .  Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ?  I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy .  Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry . Did you see Ally Mabel last night ?  Yes , I did . Did you ?  Yes , wasn't it funny ?  Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ?  Ha , yes , brilliant ! Look out ! Your tea water is running over .  Oh , would you please turn off the fire ? My hands are sticky with the dough .  Sure .  Thanks . Did you see May today ?  Yes , but why does she have such a long face ?  I don't have the foggiest idea .  I thought she'd be happy .  Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently .  I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem . I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class .  You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so .  I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately .  You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you .  Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting .  No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet .  Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment .  Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ?  Don ’ t bother . I will help myself .  Make yourself at home .  It is such a nice place .  Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ?  John , I am just not in the mood for this .  You look so upset . What's going on ?  I lost the table tennis game yesterday .  Oh , what a pity !  I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more .  Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game .  My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis .  Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed .  Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure .  I understand . The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?  It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .  Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?  Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...  Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .  You're dancing so well .  You dance beautifully too .  When did you learn to dance ?  In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?  It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .  How about tango ?  Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?  Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped )  Thank you for the dance .  My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .  OK . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .  Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .  We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .  The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it .  I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? I just had a terrible week .  What a shame !  I fell down and hurt my arm .  That's too bad .  Then my son drove into a tree .  I'm sorry to hear that .  The dog bit the delivery boy .  What a pity !  And a storm blew our roof away .  Ho , no ! I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !  My first grandchild .  And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does .  Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though .  Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does .  Well , children usually resemble their parents .  It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is .  You often like comparing children with their parents .  You ’ re right . When do you go to bed usually ?  I go to bed at ten and get up at six .  That's helpful for your health .  Sure . Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ?  When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?  The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .  That's right . Why do you ask ?  Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .  When are getting married ?  Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .  Congratulations ! I had no idea .  Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?  Do you like amusement parks ?  For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .  If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .  Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?  Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .  Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .  I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! Can you speak French ?  Yes , I can , but not very well .  Can you understand your Spanish teacher ?  More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ?  About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e you look better today . How did your test go ?  much better than it did yesterday .  did you pass ?  I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy !  you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it .  thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass .  you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor .  did you always do well at school ?  no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams .  really ?  sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ?  I'll get my finals in two months .  when do you plan on studying for those exams ?  most students just cram the night forehead .  do you think that's a good idea ?  no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam .  that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ?  I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant .  it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ?  Oh , you don't ask much , do you ?  I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition .  I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones .  That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us .  Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting !  Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it .  Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . Do you want to go to the beach tonight ?  Sure , which beach are we going to ?  I wanted to go to Malibu beach .  I like Santa Monica .  The water there looks so dirty .  I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica .  I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night .  Is Malibu beach nice ?  It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better .  So you want to go to Malibu ?  If that's okay with you .  Sure , let's go to Malibu . There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?  I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late .  We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection .  Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life .  In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food .  It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people .  Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment .  I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ?  I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef .  You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking !  Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it .  When did you change your mind ?  After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family .  I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ?  Yeah . I went to California to study .  Really ? How long did you stay there ?  I was there between 88 and 90 .  And what did you do after that ?  Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend .  A house warming party ?  Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn .  Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy .  Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive .  I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city .  That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .  I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . What can I do for you ?  I am trying to find this book .  What ’ s the problem ?  It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it .  Have you checked the computer ?  I have already .  What did it say ?  It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there .  I can always borrow the book from another library .  You can do that ?  I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in .  That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ?  I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ?  We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun .  What is the rate ?  Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth .  How about mileage and gas ?  There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included .  OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week .  All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ?  Here you are . Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ?  Sure , I'd love to . Which film shall we see ?  There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ?  Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall .  Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ?  No , I'm not hungry .  Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ?  Yes , that's true .  How long is the holiday ?  It depends.But usually it's about 15 days .  Do you eat any special food for the festival ?  Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck .  That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ?  Yes , it's really wonderful !  Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing .  I'm sure you'll have a good time . I'm really sick of waiting for a bus .  Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do .  But a taxi costs too much .  That's true . I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose .  do you have any other symptoms ?  I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ?  just a little . Has your toothache gone now ?  yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway .  how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ?  no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed .  how did you get that burn again ?  I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago .  you haven't had much luck lately , have you ?  no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon .  when's the last time you took your tablets ?  I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch .  I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ?  just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much .  sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ?  that sounds good .  soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him .  Why don't you find someone who is in the know .  I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know .  Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him .  Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . What are you two doing in here ?  We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you .  I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was .  Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside .  All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ?  I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ?  Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .  With the job ?  With everything , with everybody , with all this !  A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday .  It wasn't always like this , you know .  What do you mean ?  Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives .  You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter .  Certainly , perhaps . Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside .  Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break .  Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry .  Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much .  My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before .  Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town !  Well , thanks for the suggestions .  Oh , don't mention it . Dad , what's the date ?  It's December eighteenth .  In seven days it will be Christmas Day .  Yes , I know that .  So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ?  Sure , a promise is a promise . What happen , John ?  Nothing .  Why do you look unhappy ?  I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .  Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . This man is your fiance , Dolly ?  Yeah , how do you like him ?  He's handsome .  Can you give me a touch of his character ?  He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ?  Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ?  No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ...  It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ...  They're going to give us back the seats ?  No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ...  Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ?  You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas .  Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! The world changes , the family changes too .  What do you mean ?  People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child .  That is called a nuclear family .  I don't like such a family .  What kind of family are you like ?  I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children .  It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well .  We can live well , I think . What was that all about ?  We had a difference of opinion .  Is she going to be okay ?  She'll be fine . Is sailing fun ?  You bet ! John dates her seven times a week .  Really ? That's a straws in the wind .  I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her .  Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl .  Right . I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down .  I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste .  Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . Good morning , Loans .  Good morning , Mr . Smith .  I would like to compliment you on your diligence .  Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job .  Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans .  It's nice of you to say so . Which countries have you been to ?  I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada .  I thought you had been to Australia too .  No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?  I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains .  Isn ’ t it really cold there ?  Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter .  I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . Alison , would you like to have some more ?  No thanks . I have had enough .  Actually you haven't have much .  To tell you the truth , I am on the diet .  That sounds ridiculous . Why ?  Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come .  Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you !  Thank you , shall I open it now ?  Yes , please do .  Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you .  Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself .  Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ?  No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ?  Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics .  I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market .  Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them .  I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it .  I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ?  I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .  No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party .  Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like .  I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored .  I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves .  Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 Hi , it is a pleasant surprise !  Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ?  Couldn ’ t be better . And you ?  Just as usual , you know . Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ?  Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything .  The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy .  Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !  I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?  You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?  Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .  Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .  Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? The weather in Beijing is just beautiful !  Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know .  Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away .  What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ?  Autumn is also very nice in Washington .  Is it very cold in winter there ?  No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter .  Does it rain a lot in summer there ?  Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ?  There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn .  I feel it's rather dry here .  That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here .  Are you from the south ?  No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually .  I see.so this is your hometown ? Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid !  Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ?  Yes , it is . How do you know that ?  Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting .  Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ?  I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings .  That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture .  I love this art exhibition !  So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ?  OK . Lousy weather , isn't it ?  It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder .  Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves .  And the streets are covered with snow .  Do you know what the temperature is today ?  I missed today's weather forecast over the TV .  It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery .  The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports .  That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off .  You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ?  Very well . If I leave I'll miss you .  Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston .  I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you .  OK , they begin to register .  It's time I left .  Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . What are your working hours ?  Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon .  Much better than mine .  What are your hours ?  Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ?  For What ?  Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .  Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ?  I went to Yale University .  Did you ? And what did you study ?  I have a B . A . in Economics .  Would you mind telling me how old you are ?  I'm twenty-seven .  And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?  Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years .  And what was your salary at the bank ?  I got $ 500 a week . Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?  I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired .  Late night ?  Yeah , I got home around two . I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ?  Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette .  How did that happen ?  A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face .  Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . What do you do for a living ?  I ’ m a doctor .  Really ? Do you like it ?  Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ?  I ’ m a bus driver .  Oh , do you enjoy it ?  No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips !  that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well .  all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific .  thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ?  no problem .  now let's have one together .  do you know how to set the timer ?  let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here .  OK , let's have a try .  cheese ...  did it come out ?  yes , but it's blurred and a little dark .  never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again .  Ok , let's go . Did you watch television last night , Charles ?  Yes , I did .  It was a good game , wasn't it ?  Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film .  What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well .  How did it finish ?  It finished in a draw . What was the film like ?  It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first .  Did your wife enjoy it ?  No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ?  It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts .  I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ?  She made another white crack about my clothes .  Are you sure she was trying to put you down ?  Of course , I am sure .  You shall go easy on her . she is new here .  Just how am I supposed to do that ?  You shall just take it in surprise .  I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons .  Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ?  I am not . she is no picnic .  Well . if you think I can help , let me know .  Thanks , Serena . I ’ m forming a music band .  Do you already know how to play an instrument ?  Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .  Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?  We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?  Yes , I ’ m a singer .  Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .  Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport .  Oh , thanks a lot .  What time are you leaving ?  1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m .  What airline and what flight ?  Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 .  I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m .  Ok . See you tomorrow . I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide .  Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 .  I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference .  Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?  I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . Hello , Friendship Restaurant . May I help you ?  I'd like to book a table tonight .  Yes , Sir . For how many people , please ?  Eight .  What time ?  Eight o'clock tonight , would you please set us in a private room ?  So sorry , we're fully booked in that room . Would you like to make reservation some other time ?  Maybe not , thank you all the same then . Hey , Zina . You're here early today .  Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast .  I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it .  Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome .  Fair enough.Keep up the good work . That is the most beautiful sunset !  Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute .  Here is a good place . Let's get out .  Wow . We don't get to see this in the city !  Mother Nature is quite an artist .  Look behind us at the mountains ! They're reflecting pink !  Amazing . The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere !  Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film ! What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ?  Sure.Where would you suggest ?  How about going to the suburbs ?  Sounds good . Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?  Sorry , I thought you knew .  But you should have told me you were in love with her .  Didn't I ?  You know you didn't .  Well , I'm telling you now .  Yes , but you might have told me before .  I didn't think you'd be interested .  You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .  Oh , you men ! You're all the same . Hi , Bill .  Hi , Jim .  Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks .  He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy .  Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ?  Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . Where's Tom this evening ?  He's a little sick under the weather .  Really ! What's the matter with him ?  He has the flu .  Tell him I was asking about him .  I will . Maybe you should talk to the teacher .  No , it's no use .  You never know unless you try .  I know . She won't change my grade . well , I finished my last final today .  the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree !  do you want to attend the convocation ?  certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ?  do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ?  oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day .  no . those you have to provide for yourself .  what do most of the students do ?  well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f  then , I might as well have them made .  Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty .  hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin .  it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' .  here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ?  Certainly . Ok , got you . Do you mind if I ask you a question ?  No , not at all . Go ahead .  What do you do in order to improve your English ?  I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get .  It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ?  Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension .  It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ?  It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . Good morning , Sue .  Good morning , Tom.How are you ?  I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ?  Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ?  I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ?  I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run .  See you later , alligator .  After a while , crocodile . Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine .  It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important .  What methods do you use to conserve water ?  Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water .  I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .  Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .  We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .  The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it .  I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . Hurry up . Time is running out .  I see . I have run as fast as I can . Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ?  Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section .  Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this  Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?  It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done .  It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home !  It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b  Is that better ?  Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ?  Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make .  That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any Can you tell me the time ?  It's 5:30 by my watch .  Is your watch right ?  Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night .  Are you angry , Lisa ?  Angry ? Why would I be ?  Please don't tell my mom .  Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already .  I'm glad that you see it that way .  Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you .  Thank you so much , Lisa ! Hi , Mary , long time no see .  I heard through the grapevine that your getting married .  Yes , next March .  Congratulations , I hope everything works out . Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ?  I wouldn't say so .  What do you mean ?  Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . is everything alright ?  yes , everything is fine .  what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !  didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?  I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ?  we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem .  then what ? Your plane was three hours late !  we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight .  turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ?  yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early .  so where did you land ?  we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again .  that sounds like a nightmare !  it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive .  have you had anything to eat ?  I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ?  I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me .  What's that ?  I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry .  Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ?  No , thank you .  That's the most important thing .  It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid .  Forget about it .  When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway .  Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well .  I appreciate that , thank you . What date is it today ?  Today is December 23,2002 .  Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas .  Merry Christmas to you ! Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now .  Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you .  Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody .  It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ?  Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family .  We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ?  About 4 .  OK . Do you want us to bring something ?  No , just come here .  OK , see you later .  Bye . You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor .  Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry .  Luckily that was nothing serious .  Thank God ! I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida .  That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there .  But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin .  You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer .  I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good .  You said it . I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article .  What does it say ?  A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it .  Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother .  Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me .  I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . Thanks for coming shopping with me .  I'm so honored that you thought to ask me .  I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before .  You're going to do great . And you're going to look great .  Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion .  I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you .  The question is , can he have it done before Friday ?  These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . I love slim girls , don ’ t you ?  Not particularly . I like fat girls .  And I like a girl with good skin , do you ?  I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners .  Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure .  Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality .  But you like a girl to be rich , surely ?  Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . What's going on here ?  We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year !  Master Li ? Who's that ?  He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line !  I will ! I could use some good luck ! I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ?  Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important .  I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting !  You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose .  In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up .  Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! What day is today ?  It's Thursday , I think .  Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend .  We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend .  We'll meet again in a few days . I decided to go for this kind of life .  Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take .  I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .  Then you will be in line for a doom . What day is it today ?  It's Friday . Are you new to this school ?  Yes , I ’ m new .  Is this your first year in college ?  I transferred from another school .  Where did you transfer from ?  I was at PCC before .  Why did you transfer ?  I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough .  Did you like it at PCC ?  PCC is an incredible school .  Well , I wish you luck here .  I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . There is something wrong with my girlfriend .  What's the trouble ?  The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her .  What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ?  Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know .  Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? Are you ready to go to the bank ?  Sure , what do you need to do there ?  There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM .  I have to exchange some money .  that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week .  I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week .  I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest .  Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .  would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it .  I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .  What do you mean ?  Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together .  I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .  People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do .  I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .  I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .  The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .  Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .  You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! Hey Mike . What are you doing ?  Nothing much . What are you up to ?  I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately .  He took the civil service exam and failed .  That sucks . He must feel depressed .  Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days .  Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him .  That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else .  Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done .  Sounds good . Did you hear Peter just retired ?  Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ?  He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty .  Really ? He looks so young . Hello , Steven . Congratulations !  Thank you .  How's your married life ?  We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple .  That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right .  The situation differs in person . We have waited for a long time . When will we start ?  Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you !  I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week .  Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ...  No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .  What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .  They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .  That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?  I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .  it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural !  I felt as if I had been in a different world .  And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening .  Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ?  Nonsmoking , please .  All right . May I have your name ?  My surname is Gao .  How do you spell it , sir ? OK . Come back into the classroom , class .  Does the class start again , Mam ?  Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough .  Oh , breaktime flies .  come on , baby . It ’ s time now .  Mam , another minute , could I ?  Hurry up , little boy . why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up !  oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company .  it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer .  but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again .  why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it .  she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys .  that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ?  I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time .  I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind .  I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ?  just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job .  do you think it will work ?  sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try .  ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris .  sure . Good luck , Maria ! Where did you go yesterday ?  I went to play tennis in the public park .  How often do you play tennis ?  Twice a week . How about you ?  I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball .  What is very difficult to gather team player together .  I usually play with my school-mates .  Do you like watching football matches ?  Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . Why are you all dressed up ?  I've got a date . I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office .  Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ?  What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one .  Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people .  And what did the program say ?  It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier .  I think that many physicians now agree with that idea .  And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .  And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits .  I was playing a joke on you .  That ’ s too much .  Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . Where are you going this weekend ?  I ’ m going to Hainan .  Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ?  Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October .  I see . What ’ s it like there ?  Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier !  Well , have a great time ! Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time .  All right , Sis !  Come on , it's cool outside .  I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us .  Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ?  Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today .  What ? Are you crazy ?  I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out .  Ew , Danny , gross !  By the way , what's your favorite weather ?  I love snowy , because it is very very romantic .  Look , is that Tom ? My girlfriend dumped me .  Well , that's life . Did Roll win the race ?  Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth .  But anyway , he won at last .  Yeah . To win is the most important thing . What's this then ?  It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us .  But this should have been handed in last Thursday .  Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry .  Well , what's your excuse then ?  My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home .  Oh , Yes ?  It's true , sir . Hey , This is your order .  Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before .  Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now .  Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ?  Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English .  Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ?  No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English .  Very nice . Thank you for your time .  Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips .  OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble .  Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ?  OK . But I'd like some cookies .  Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker .  I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here .  Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly .  It's OK . Thank you . Do you think the bad weather will last long ?  I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time .  I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it .  I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time .  Good idea . Thanks a billion . Let's go in .  After you . Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ?  Pardon ?  What university would you enter ?  University ? Why ? You asked me last year .  Oh , I forget . Sorry .  I went to Harvard University .  Did you ? And what course did you take there ?  God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ?  I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory .  I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ?  Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . I think he deserved his gold .  Did you see his last dive ?  Yes , it's perfect !  He's diving for the gold . You are studying here , aren ’ t you ?  Yes . I have been here for three years .  Do you like this campus ?  Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it .  How come ?  It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected .  Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped .  I ’ ll just have to put up with it . How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe !  Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck .  I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . Hi Mark .  Hi .  What are you planning to do today ?  I'm not sure yet .  Would you like to have lunch with me ?  Yes . When ?  Is 11:30 AM OK ?  Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ?  I said , 11:30 AM .  Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ?  OK , how about 12:30 PM ?  OK . Where ?  How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ?  Oh , Where is that ?  It's on 7th Street .  OK , I'll meet you there . How have you been ?  Fine , thanks . How about you ? Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company .  Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it .  You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?  Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions .  Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something .  Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . I hate to say goodbye , but it's late .  Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 .  I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go .  OK.See you on Today .  See you on Moday.Have a great weekend .  You too.Thanks for dropping in . Are you really dating with Frank ?  Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking .  Then why not keep away from him ?  The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now .  That ’ s stupid . Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while .  I'm fine . I've been out of town . I just got back .  Where were you ?  I was in New York for a wedding . What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ?  I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it .  What do you like best about it ?  I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart .  What do you think of the ending ?  The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall .  Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing .  That ’ s right .  You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it . Is that your phone ?  Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ?  It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ?  Yes , it's got wireless Internet access .  That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ?  Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ?  No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go .  Yes , I guess I should try to use it . Good morning , Mary !  Good morning , John !  I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?  I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ?  Yes , if that's all right for you .  I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ?  Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .  That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time .  I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition .  It doesn't matter . Forget it .  I don't think I performed well .  Oh ! That's much hetter than I did .  Can you tell me how to improve myself ?  There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed .  Thank you for your encouragement .  It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . I just dropped in to say goodbye .  What time are you leaving ?  I'll leave at 10 o'clock .  Take care and give my best to you parents .  Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . Come back . You haven't paid yet .  May , just let him go .  But he took some newspaper away without paying .  I know .  Why ? You make me confused .  He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later .  Why does he have such a privilege ?  He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him .  I see . Does he live by himself ?  Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle .  He must be lonely ?  I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories .  How respectable ! How may I help you ?  I need to get on the Internet .  Do you have your library card with you ?  Yes , I have it .  You ’ re going to have to wait for a computer .  That ’ s okay .  Please put your name on this list .  Then what do I need to do ?  When there is a computer available , I will call you .  What do I do to log on to the computer ?  Just type in the number on the back of your library card .  Okay . Thanks for your help . Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ?  Yes , I am . When is the wedding ?  Aug 8 .  August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ?  Mrs . White .  Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago .  Maybe her uncle will .  I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ?  Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding .  Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ?  Yes , Jane says they will go to China . Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger .  No problem . I can deal with it well .  You will ask for it .  All is best now , isn ’ t it ? Hurry up ! Time is money !  Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time .  But you are too slow to follow them .  Don't you see I'm trying my best ? Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful .  Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting .  You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful .  Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened .  Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . Steve , you look pale . What happened ?  I didn't sleep a wink last night .  Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you .  Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects .  Is there anything I can do to help you ?  Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo .  Sure , When is good time for you ?  Can you make it on Tuesday ?  What time do you want me there ?  Anytime after six will be fine .  All right , It's a date . My friend Jean is very beautiful .  What's her figure ?  Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .  What's the color of her eyes ?  Dark blue . What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ?  I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?  About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .  I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .  Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .  Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .  How ’ s your son these days ?  Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .  He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?  I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .  Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .  Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?  Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .  Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .  It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ?  You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful .  Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ?  No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way .  Did you register yet ?  Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss .  What classes do you think are still open ?  Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology .  That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester .  I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full .  He does that ?  I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class .  That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help .  No problem , man . Thanks for helping me move into my new house .  Any time . I'm just glad I could help . I've been so stressed these days .  What's the matter ? Are you OK ?  I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in .  Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide .  And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family .  You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college .  OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ?  In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money !  OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality .  That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ?  En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center .  Is the training center helpful ?  I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . I'm glad we live in a small town .  Why ?  Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time .  Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ?  Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ?  I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother .  When can you come ?  I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . You know , smoking does do harm to your health .  Yes , you're right .  Why don't you try to give it up ?  I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me .  Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually .  Yes , maybe I should have another try . Hello , Jim . What was the film like ?  Awful . It was a complete waste of time .  Why ? What was it about ?  It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own .  A lot of young people have to do that .  Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired .  lt sounds like the story of my life .  Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night .  I take sleeping pills sometimes .  Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital .  It sounds a very depressing film .  Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end ,  I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . Would you like to stretch your legs ?  Sure .  Let's get a soft drink .  Do we have enough time ?  It's a fifteen-minute intermission .  The seats are excellent . We're right in the center .  It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .  I can't agree more .  Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?  In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents .  Do you have large concert halls in your city ?  We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller .  That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . May I help you ?  What time will the library be closing ?  It closes at six .  Does it always close at six ?  No , not every day .  Will the library be open on Saturday ?  Absolutely .  What are your hours on Saturday ?  Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night .  All right . Thank you .  What else can I help you with ?  That ’ s it . Thank you . Whose part do you think is best played ?  That of the old man .  You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best .  Some of the scenes moved me into tears . Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker .  Pardon ?  I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon .  Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad .  It isn't Elvin .  Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious .  Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . Hello , Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here !  Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time .  How's life going , Zhang Lin ?  Yes , the same as ever , thanks . What about you ?  Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle .  Good bye then , and keep in touch .  Good bye . Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason .  Yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . But ...  But what ?  But he is always talking big . What a great weekend that was !  My feelings exactly .  I really enjoy the beach in the summer .  I couldn't agree with you more .  We should come here more often .  You are absolutely right .  I'd like to come back next weekend .  That's exactly the way I feel . Aren ’ t you going to swim ?  Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ?  You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ?  Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now .  What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ?  Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit .  All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming .  Jim !  Yes ?  Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand .  I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ?  Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ?  I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain .  I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures .  I ’ m sure they will . Adam , could you show me around the school ?  No problem .  What's the tallest building ?  You mean the white building near the playground ?  Yes .  That is the library . And it has more than 1,000 , 000 books .  What's the building to the south of the library ?  You know , our school is divided into two parts , the junior high school and the senior high school . That is the new classroom building for our senior high school .  Is there a swimming pool in your school ?  Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer .  I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day .  I believe that you can make your dream come true . Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ?  I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish .  Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ?  Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching .  Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ?  Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things .  Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ?  Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . Don't be shy . Have some more chicken .  Thanks . I feel pity for the old man .  I feel the same way .  It must be dreadful to grow old .  Yeah . He has no one to count on . I'm going to see the doctor this weekend .  What's your trouble ?  I think I need a thorough check-up .  I got it . Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today .  What is the problem ?  I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .  Are you planning on having someone take notes for you ?  Yes , I've got that part covered .  When , exactly do you need to leave ?  I don't need to leave until the very end of class .  Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again .  Thanks , Professor . See you later !  See you later ! Drive carefully . I'm going to try sky diving this weekend .  I wouldn't do it if I were you .  It's sounds like fun .  It's very dangerous , you know .  I want to try something exciting .  It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you .  I'll tell you all about it next Monday .  Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ?  I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act .  He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves .  But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis .  What's he like ?  Oh , he's a very serious person .  You must feel very uneasy at his home . Hi ! My name is Mike .  Hi ! I'm Nancy . Nice to meet you .  Nice to meet you , too .  Where are you from ?  I'm from Shanghai . And you ?  I'm from Chicago . Why do you go fishing so often ?  It's fun . Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you .  Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already .  It ’ s all right .  I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting .  I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ?  Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up .  I totally understand . Good morning , Jim !  Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ?  Yes , it is . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze .  It is the best season for a picnic right now . Have you decided the place for your picnic ?  We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ?  What did the whetherman say ?  He ’ s predicting clear skies .  Well , I will think it over . Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?  Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?  Yes , I am applying on it .  I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ...  Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .  I know , but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field .  Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll .  Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ...  Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ?  Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play .  You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ...  Alright ... I get your point . How do you like your job here , Linda ?  It's interesting , I like being an editor .  Why ?  I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people .  I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring .  I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry .  Do you have any complaints ?  No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?  Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .  That's perfect . I will definitely do well . I don't think we've met .  No , I don't think we have .  My name is Dick Brown .  How do you do ? Mr . Brown . I am Susan Heywood .  Mr . Smith often talked about you .  Really ? I am glad to meet you .  I'm honored to know you . Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?  I don ’ t want to .  Well , come and talk to me then .  Certainly not .  May I turn on the radio then ?  Turn on the radio ? What for ?  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .  Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ?  Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .  To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . David , why don't you clean your room ?  I am not in the mood .  Why are you feeling depress ?  I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown .  I don't think she would do such a thing .  But she did and it made me disappointed .  Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything .  But she means a lot to me .  Then forgive her mistake .  Oh , I just can't forget it . My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday  What happened ?  She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt .  Let's buy some flowers , and pay her a visit  We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon  OK . Let's go What are the good sights to see in Beijing ?  Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too . Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy .  Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you .  Nice meeting you , too .  Come over and visit when you have time .  Thanks for the invitation . I will ! What do you do when you are angry ?  I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger .  That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ?  Something like listening to music is a good idea .  Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?  Classic . Something that could calm your mind .  I think that might work for me as well .  Working out is another good way to relieve anger .  Like what ?  Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party .  What a shame ! Taylor , you're sweating up a storm !  Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out .  Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun .  You're like the tenth person to say that .  We're just worried about you , Taylor .  Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone ! She is so stupid .  Who cares ? She is pretty .  So what ?  You're just jealous . Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you !  Thank you.You ' re partial .  I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day .  It's nice to hear that anyway . What a police officer !  I ’ Ve never seem such a scene either except in films .  It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin . In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ?  The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side .  Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ?  They usually do . Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ?  He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while .  That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some .  Make it three cups . Here comes Harry . Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?  Because Myra was cheating on exams.and she spoke back rudely .  I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . Is your city a historical place ?  Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village .  How did it grow into such a large place ?  Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .  As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .  Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .  I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?  Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too .  Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . What is wrong with your face ?  My brother did it .  Why ?  I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . How's Jerry's new school ?  Very nice . He gets along with his classmates very well .  He's a team player .  Yes , indeed . How many people are there in your family ?  Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .  Is your brother older or younger than you ?  He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . What's the problem ? You don't look happy .  I failed my oral test .  How come ?  I'm not practicing enough .  Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often ?  When I talk to Chinese , I always want to speak Chinese .  You should always keep in mind , the more you practice , the better English you can speak . It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go .  Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . Did you get the car you wanted ?  No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .  What about the car over there ?  It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . How may I help you ?  I want to return this video .  Is that all you need ?  I also need to check this magazine out .  You ’ re not allowed to do that .  I don ’ t understand .  It ’ s our policy .  What can I check out ?  Only books or videos .  I need this magazine .  You will have to read it here .  That ’ s weird . Have you heard the news ?  No . What happened ? Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today .  Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune .  Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?  Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total .  Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over .  But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !  Why can't we ?  It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ?  I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon .  But we can't have thirteen for dinner !  I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything .  Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !  Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner .  That's better . Hello , 8520388 2 .  Hi , this is Maria . Is that Shirley ?  Hi , Maria , this is Shirley .  Shirley , do you know today's homework from our economic law class ? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now .  Hold on for a moment please . I'm fetching my textbook .  OK .  Oh , the homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense .  Explain the economic law ? An essay question again ?  Yes . You can use your textbook for your reference .  Are there any clear answers in the book to this question ?  I don't think so , Maria , but I think you can look for information on the Internet .  OK , thank you , Shirley . You are very helpful . I have another question . When does the Economic Law of China come into effect ?  Oh , there isn't such a code called economic law . The Economic Law of China is a general concept for several laws .  There isn't such a code ?  Yes , it's a general name for several laws related to economics , like Commercial Law , and Law of Central Bank .  Got it . Thank you , Shirley . I just dropped in to say goodbye .  What time are you leaving ?  I ’ ll leave at ten o ’ clock .  Take care , and give my best to your parents .  Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing .  They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today .  So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ?  Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week .  Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ?  Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic .  ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ?  Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing .  Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ?  She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang .  Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking .  You are such an expert on it . I don't know that .  You know , interest is the best teacher .  So , want me to book the tickets again ?  Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing .  We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend .  That will be great . That was heaven !  The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you .  Really ?  But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body .  Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! You got a letter in the mail .  Give it to me .  What is it ?  It ’ s from NYU .  What does it say ?  I didn ’ t get accepted .  You can ’ t be serious !  I ’ m serious .  Are you all right ?  NYU was my first choice .  I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in .  I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ?  Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot .  You are going to take courses ?  Yes . I am going to take some university courses there .  Sounds hard .  Yes , but I think it's probably for the best .  Won't you get lonely ?  Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning .  Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue .  So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs .  I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon .  We really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round .  If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either .  I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable .  The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable . Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together .  Birds of a feather flock together . What ’ s your new job like ?  Oh , it ’ s fine . I ’ Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office .  Um .  And a company car .  Very nice .  Yes , it is . But I ’ Ve got a lot of work too .  Well , that ’ s life , isn ’ t it ? What a surprise meeting you here , Landy .  I ’ m here as a tourist .  It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ?  Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . So you're traveling around the world , aren't you .  That's right  When did you arrive here ?  Last night  Did you have a good journey ?  Yes , I enjoyed it very much .  Where have you been on this trip ?  Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain  Really ? How long will your holiday last ?  Two weeks  All these countries in two weeks ?  That's right Please do excuse me for a moment . I've got diarrhea .  It's easy to get loose bowels in summer .  It may have something to do with the food I had last night  You ’ Ve got to be careful on the food you eat .  I will . Thank you . Hi Mary , how's it going ?  Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann .  Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends .  Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper .  Really ? What happened ?  It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all .  That's pretty harsh .  I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?  You know she probably feels just as bad .  Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often .  Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want .  Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you .  Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again .  How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you !  Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please ! Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long .  Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts .  That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated .  You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old .  No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again .  One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished .  How could he make such a silly mistake ?  He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then .  He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ?  Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects .  That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . What did you do over the weekend ?  I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .  Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?  It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .  Like what ?  Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .  What else can we do to protect the environment ?  If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy .  How about recycling ? Does that actually help ?  Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .  What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?  I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .  I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !  To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . Merry Christmas , Bill !  Merry Christmas . Steven !  What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ?  I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping . What about you ?  I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party . Would you like to come ?  I'd love to . But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now . See you later .  See you . So Emily , what do you like to do for fun ?  I like to go to the movies . What do you do in your free time ?  I also like going to the movies .  Well that's great ! It's nice that we have something in common . Who broke the glass , Peter ?  That cat .  I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam .  It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry . Can you read what this says ?  Yes , and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face .  Don't dis my hair ! I like it like this .  You like it , but it's getting to be a handicap for you .  Hey , that's enough about my hair .  I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too .  I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute .  Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too ? Hello , Tony . Fancy meeting you here . How are things going with you ?  Not too bad , thanks . And you ?  Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ?  Oh , they are fine . They are enjoying their retirement .  Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Well , I am going to a football match . I need to go .  Say hi to your family for me .  Thanks , I will , byebye ! Where should I sit ?  Why don't you sit in the back with me ?  Okay .  By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is .  It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N .  R-I-N ?  My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin .  I got it . Mary Lin .  Lin is a common Chinese last name . You ’ re ready , right ?  Ready for what ?  Are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?  Yes . I am ready .  You ’ re not nervous ?  Of course I ’ m nervous .  What are you most nervous about ?  I won ’ t know anybody at that school .  You shouldn ’ t be nervous about that .  Why not ?  Meeting new people is a good thing .  That ’ s a good way to think about it . What do you think of this one ?  Eh , so so .  And this one ? Too flashy ?  Nah , not too flashy .  Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?  I guess .  Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .  And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !  Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !  Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !  Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !  Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?  I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !  And Merry Christmas !  Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy .  How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed .  But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts .  Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ?  It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them .  Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff .  You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ?  You can say that .  But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ?  They must have mixed hackers with crackers .  What is crackers then ?  There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them .  So they are two totally different concepts .  Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end .  I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them .  You got it .  Thanks a lot .  You are welcome . I don't have my homework today .  You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ?  I was really sick .  But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ?  Yes , I probably could .  You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ?  Next class meeting .  That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ?  That would work for me .  Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . What are you reading about in that science magazine ?  There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning .  I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing .  According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human .  In the future , that could be possible .  In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original !  Really ? What else have you discovered ?  I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune  That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . Thanks for helping me up .  Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger .  I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over !  That takes talent ...  I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing !  He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . How was the party yesterday ?  Did you enjoy it ?  Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had .  Why ! what happened ?  Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind .  So how long did you stay ?  I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ?  I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory .  When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?  Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time .  There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?  I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground .  There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?  I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell .  You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait .  If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . Where did you go yesterday ?  I went to play tennis in the public park .  How often do you play tennis ?  Twice a week . How about you ?  I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball .  But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .  I usually play with my schoolmates .  Do you like watching football matches ?  Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday .  Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . Where is your native place ?  My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city .  So are you a local ?  Yes , I am a local resident . What ’ re you doing now ?  I ’ m watching TV .  You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed .  I will .  And don ’ t ever forget it . How can I help you today , Alice ?  Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship .  Oh , good . You're an excellent student . I'd be very willing to help you with that .  Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship .  What kind of scholarship is it ?  It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American .  Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher .  I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 .  Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it .  Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too .  Do you have an essay you want to send them ?  No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose .  What is the question ?  They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced .  That's a pretty short essay .  Yes , but I need to write it by next week .  Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job .  I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors .  Sure . What are they ?  First , I need a letter of recommendation .  I'd be happy to write one for you .  And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal .  What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ?  Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions .  Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon .  I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning .  Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend .  That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful .  Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . Did you hear how cold it got last night ?  I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero .  It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car .  My car didn't want to start either at first .  Don't you have a garage ?  Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot .  How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero .  I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero .  Does it ever get that cold on here ?  Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below .  Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?  I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .  Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .  I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .  You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . What's the matter with you , Paul ?  I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold .  Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .  Yeah , I will . You look pale today .  I didn't wear make-up this morning .  You should do sports to keep young .  You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . Steven , have you any friend in London ?  Yes , my old friend Hanson lives there  Are you close ?  Yes . He's one of my best friends . Our friendship formed at college . Why did you ask that ?  I'm going to London on business next week . But I know nothing about it .  I get it . You want to find a guide , don ’ t you ?  Yes , Steven . You always know what I want .  Don ’ t worry . I will call Hanson , and ask him to help you .  Thank you ! My word , you do look ill !  I'm quite out of thoughts recently .  You seem to have something on mind . Promise me , go to see the doctor right now .  I'm worrying about my exam .  A piece of cake . You'll be successful . Excuse me , you look familiar . Did you use to live in New York ?  Yes .  Did you use to work at NYU ?  Yes , I did .  Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student .  Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ?  Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university .  I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ?  Yes , he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now .  A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ?  Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers .  Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?  Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest .  Really ? Congratulations !  Thank you , Paul .  By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .  Good , happy birthday to you !  Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?  Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .  My pleasure . Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person !  Hello sir . Good to meet you , too .  Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason .  Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ?  Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night !  Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ?  The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason .  That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ?  Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway .  So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ?  I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall .  That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive . What are you going to do after you return from Washington ?  I'm going to stay in the city .  What will you do all day ?  I'm going to work with my father at the store . In the evening , I'll read books.On weekends , I'll go to the beach with my family .  Have you ever worked ?  No , but I can learn . What are you going to do this summer ?  I'm going to camp . I've gone to camp for four summers .  I've never gone to camp . What do you do there ?  We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories .  That sounds wonderful .  It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ?  I think he's going to the mountains with his parents .  Well , so long , Mary . Have fun .  You too , Peter . Give my regards to John . I'll see you in September . Can you tell the result ?  It's love all .  Now the score is in our favor .  Can you tell which team seems to win ?  Hard to say.Now the score is in our favor .  Yes.Our guest team is really tough .  They're still fighting hard.Let ' s wait and see . Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue .  I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ?  And let them ruin my life ? Forget it !  But you've been looking for that stamp for years .  It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills .  Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck .  Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . Kate , what do you like to do tonight ? Do you often go to the movies ?  Of course . I often go to the movies .  There ’ s a good movie called Summer in Beijing .  I heard it ’ s a very good movie .  Let ’ s find out what time it starts .  Let ’ s look at the newspaper .  Here it is . It starts at 8 o'clock .  Wonderful . I ’ m so excited . I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works .  Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective .  Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club .  You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat .  I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . I visited the Polar Aquarium today .  Is it like a zoo of polar animals ?  Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them .  It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds .  Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days .  Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . How time flies !  May and Danny have already grown up .  I can still remember our first date .  Look at that big tree over there .  Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there .  Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight .  You were dull at that time .  But you agreed to go out with me at last .  I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married . I can ’ t wait to retire .  And then what ?  And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day !  That sounds boring to me .  What do you plan on doing after you retire ?  Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher .  I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ?  Sounds good , when ?  When is it convenient for you ?  Any time is fine .  Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ?  Please wait for us even if we're a little late .  Never mind . I'll be waiting for you .  See you then .  OK . Bye ! I wonder if I can ask you a question .  Ask me a question ? What do you want to know ?  Well ... er ... it is just ... just that I ...  Just what ? Stop beating around the bush . Tell me what you want to know .  I ... er ... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks .  Lend you a few bucks ? No way ! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time ?  Yeah . But I ... Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S .  Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you .  You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you .  I'll miss you too , my friends . Lovely day , isn't it ?  Oh , yes . Beautiful .  You are not English , are you ?  No , I am from France . Good afternoon , would you mind if I sat here ?  Of course not .  I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ?  Laura .  Do you like this place ?  I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here .  How often ?  Well , we come here almost every month .  Who ’ s that ?  It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father .  Do you like swimming ?  No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . What ’ s the area of your country ?  It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers .  That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ?  There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north .  What ’ s the average income ?  That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars .  So your country is fairly rich .  I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years .  Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ?  I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself .  It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines .  I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others .  Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food .  I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . The answer is zero ! What a let-down !  I really want to take him over my knee .  No hard feelings . After all , he is a child .  If you say so ! Hi .  Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ...  Yeah ?  You were playing it very late last night .  Yeah ?  It kept me awake .  Oh , I'm sorry .  It kept me awake a couple of hours .  I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud .  It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me .  It's true.It was a bit loud .  I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future .  Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once .  I am glad we've straightened everything out . My mother likes to split hairs .  What do you mean by that ?  She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper .  Mothers like that . Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ?  I'm at home painting .  I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ?  I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college .  That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby .  Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it .  I think I will . Thanks for the info . What does your friend Jim do ?  He is a teacher , but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time .  He can repair cares ? I cannot believe it .  Believe me , he is the first-class . Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ?  Hi Martha . Everything is perfect .  Are you enjoying married life ?  It couldn't be better . My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much .  You're so lucky . I hope to get married to a guy like that .  I'm so happy . Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends .  Do you guys do anything special ?  In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe .  Sound like everything is great . David , why don't you clean your room ?  I am not in the mood .  Why are you feeling depress ?  I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown .  I don't think she would do such a thing .  But she did and it made me disappointed .  Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything .  But she means a lot to me .  Then forgive her mistake .  Oh , I just can't forget it . My brother joined the army last year .  Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ?  He's tall and strong .  I can tell it from your build . Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty .  Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic .  Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie .  I am also impressed with the lines in the movie .  Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get .  That's my favorite .  You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable !  It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration .  Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble .  All in all , it will never lose its appeal .  Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ?  Sure . Now you are talking . I hate this kind of weather !  When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather .  I think he had water on the brain . This is bad .  He said there are only all kinds of good weather .  Okay , Pollyanna , what's so good about this weather ?  Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home .  We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ?  I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us . What day is it ?  It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ?  I'm leaving on November 10th .  Isn't it a Sunday ?  No , it's a Monday .  So you are leaving two weeks from now ?  Right . What are you reading ?  Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller .  I thought he usually wrote horror books .  He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .  We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?  Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .  Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .  I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography .  This is sure to be a worthwhile read . Do you know what the BBS is ?  Sure .  Tell me then .  BBS means Bulletin Board Service .  Oh , I see , but what's it used for ?  A lot of things !  Tell me in details .  Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums .  Oh , that's great . I want to try later .  Why not ? Any plans tonight ?  Not really , do you ?  Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview .  Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ?  I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me .  That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ?  Just did my best . How may I help you ?  I need to return these books .  What happened to this one ?  The cover came off .  You ’ re going to need to pay for the damage .  How much are you talking ?  It ’ s going to be $ 5 .  That ’ s not bad at all .  It really isn ’ t .  Here you go .  Thank you very much .  You ’ re welcome . Have a nice day . When it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ Past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ?  Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .  But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .  If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns .  I will think about it . I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ?  He appeals to the fans thanks to two things  You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .  Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time .  In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .  Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout .  And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . Can you tell which team seems to win ?  Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor .  Yes . Our guest team is really tough .  They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see . May I have a word with you ?  Certainly .  When will you be free ?  Come by any time .  Shall I say around ten o'clock ?  Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .  Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .  Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before .  When will we get one of those ?  You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon .  Thank you . I am very excited .  We are all very proud of you .  I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won .  I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement .  It was really an exciting moment . I really dislike reading academic books .  That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale .  I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese .  Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well .  You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress !  Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs .  So you're learning Chinese songs ?  You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now .  That's a real achievement . How did you do that ?  I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer .  It makes sense .  It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow .  Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try .  Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now .  Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ?  Yes , just in case we run into me new characters .  Ok . I will bring it with me . Where to , miss ?  Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner .  Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ?  From China .  Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so .  It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products .  Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?  Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ?  Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !  Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ?  I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage .  Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?  Uh ... yeah .. of course !  Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now .  That ’ s all right . I understand .  I ’ m so sorry .  That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later . Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ?  We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do .  Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .  Like what ?  Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .  That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?  Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it .  Is the house pretty run-down .  Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her .  Was it a very old house ?  It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .  Is it in a good location ?  The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . Do Mona and Jim need a new house ?  No , they have a big new fancy house .  Does Jim make a lot of money ?  Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer .  Does Jim need to make more money ?  Afraid so . The more the better .  What do they need all that money for ?  Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money .  Do they have any children ?  No . They want children but no luck yet .  What does Jim like to do ?  Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money .  What does Mona like to do ?  Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry .  Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife .  I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government .  Politics can be an expensive hobby .  She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps .  Politics is a hard game to play .  She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . Are you alright , child ?  Hey , I still know my name .  What did the nurse say ?  She said I have a fever but nothing major .  In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest .  What if this small fever turns into a big fever ?  Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you . Who was the best teacher that you ever had ?  That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher .  What was she like ?  She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her .  What kind of things did you learn ?  She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do .  Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ?  If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it .  You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ?  She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined .  I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students .  Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .  Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ?  Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .  Do you know what she is doing now ?  As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book .  Have you ever read one of the books ?  Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books .  Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ?  ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . Mum , this is for you .  Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ?  Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum !  Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! Did you like the party ?  Not particularly . I was rather disappointed .  Why ? What had you expected ?  I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ?  To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here .  The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else .  Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ?  Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game .  Who plays who ?  Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .  It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?  In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever .  I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .  Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful .  I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .  Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .  That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy .  Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ?  You are always so naughty . Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ?  I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .  Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . Is that Mr . Green ?  This is him speaking .  I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc .  Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . I'm so nervous about this oral test .  Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well .  I just want to get it over with . I hear you ’ re taking a music class . I didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it .  Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before .  In my opinion , you ’ ll make it .  You ’ re having me on again .  No , I ’ m serious . What ’ s the date today ?  December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday .  Right . What present should we give him this time ? By the way , how old is he ?  Thirteen today and tomorrow . Fourteen the day after tomorrow .  How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now .  And don ’ t forget Mary , Tom ’ s twin sister . It ’ s her birthday , too .  OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate . Peter and Mary broke up .  Are you serious ? I had a wonderful evening .  I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ?  I will . Do you know Sally ?  Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .  Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock .  Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . Do you hear what happened to Sally ?  No , what ?  She had to go to the hospital .  Why ?  She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days .  Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy !  Yeah , but that's what she did .  I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look .  Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen .  True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ?  I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye .  Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man .  That ’ s why many people look up to him . Have you found another job yet , Sally ?  No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .  What kind of job are you looking for ?  Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel .  You haven't had any experience in either of those fields .  I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . Hi . Are you new in this class ?  Yes , I am . I really don't know anyone .  My name is Steven . What's your name ?  My name is Bill . How are your lessons going ?  Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese .  I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese .  I guess English has fewer characters .  You are right . Robert , this is my friend , Mrs . Smith .  Hi , Nice to meet you .  Nice to meet you too .  Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ?  I'm a doctor .  Oh . Where do you work ?  New York University hospital in New York City . What do you do ?  I'm a teacher .  What do you teach ?  I teach English .  Where ?  At a high school in New Jersey .  That's nice . How old are you ?  I'm 32 . Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her .  I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you .  She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married .  Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger !  Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ?  Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . .  You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible .  But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ?  It's once in blue moon .  What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ?  The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ?  No , I was out . Was it worth watching ?  You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero .  Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ?  Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it .  Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first .  What should I do then ?  I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour .  I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?  Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! How many people are there in your family ?  Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister .  That ’ s a big family . How old is your brother ?  Eighteen .  What about your sister ?  She ’ s not quite twenty-five .  Do you miss your family ?  Yes .  Do you often go home ?  No . But I often send e-mail to them . And make a call to my parents regularly .  How often do you call to them ?  Once a week . I'm terribly nervous .  Calm down ! What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ?  Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids .  The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ...  And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery !  You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .  I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .  Come on , nothing can be that bad .  But promise me , you'll keep it a secret .  Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?  I've fallen in love with my boss .  Really ? Is he married ?  Bo , of course not . He is still single .  Then what's your problem ?  I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .  Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .  Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .  Office romance is very tricky .  It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .  Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . How may I help you ?  I want to return this video .  Is that all you need ?  I also need to check these books out .  Anything else ?  That ’ s everything .  I need your library card .  I have it . Here you go .  Do you need anything else ?  That ’ s everything .  Your books are due back two weeks from today .  Thank you . Good night . Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ?  I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go .  Thanks so much .  I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish .  I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries .  So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ?  It says that traditionally , give something made of paper .  I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys .  But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon .  Yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team .  So what ?  You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance .  I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did .  I know , and I will .  When ?  After baseball practice .  And then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise .  No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you .  Well , I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me .  No problem , I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks . What stresses you out the most ?  Probably my parents .  How so ?  Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married .  You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents .  Your parents are not like that ?  Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much .  You're lucky .  What do you do to deal with the stress ?  Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning .  That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ?  Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . Tony looks very handsome in the suit .  He prefers suits to jackets .  Judge from his look , he's a very serious person .  As a matter of fact , he is . Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married .  She must be a good wife .  Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does .  I see . What's the weather like ?  I don't know . I just woke up .  Why don't you look outside ?  Okay . It looks like rain .  Why do you say that ?  The sky is gray .  Is it raining right now ?  No .  How do you know ?  The street isn't wet .  I have to go shopping today .  You'd better take an umbrella . Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?  Yeah how ’ d you know ?  You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?  Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin .  It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?  Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .  In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .  Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !  It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working .  He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep .  If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . Do you like ice skating ?  I have never tried it .  Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday .  Sorry , I don't think I can .  Friday then . How about it ?  Friday is great .  It's settled then . Gordon , you're ever so late .  Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus .  But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late .  Well , I missed several buses .  How on earth can you miss several buses ?  I , ah ... , I got have late .  Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ?  Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ...  Have you got it now ?  Yes , I found it again .  When ?  This morning . I mean ...  I am not convinced by your explanation . Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it .  Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week .  No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness .  Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen .  Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ?  Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap .  It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant .  That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much .  And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken .  But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences .  Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat .  Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . How's your new job going ?  Really well , thanks .  How are you finding your new boss ?  She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her .  Would you rather have her or your old boss back ?  She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down .  How about your new co-workers ?  They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work .  Do you miss your old co-workers ?  Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me .  Do people in different departments get along with each other ?  Sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other .  Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ?  Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives .  Do you like working in teams ?  I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . Linda , John and I are going to get married next week .  That's wonderful . Congratulations .  Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding .  I'd love to . What date is it ?  It's May 1st .  What day is that ?  It's Saturday . Could you make the time ?  Yes , sure . What time will the wedding begin ?  At nine sharp .  Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck !  Thanks . So do you think you can get to the office alone ?  Sure , I ’ ll catch the train . If I can ’ t catch the train , I ’ ll get a taxi .  Do you think the taxi driver will understand you ?  If he doesn ’ t understand me , I ’ ll show him the office address on my business card .  Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ?  I ’ ll call you if I ’ m delayed . You and Bob have finished ?  Yes .  Are you going to be okay ?  Yes , I'm used to being on my own . Tony looks very handsome in the suit .  He prefers suits to jackets .  Judge from his look , he's a very serious person .  As a matter of fact , he is . You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith .  Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil .  I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that .  Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . Wow ! It ’ s packed .  The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . it's getting cold .  yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look .  Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern .  yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ?  it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .  how about this blue sweater ?  that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?  yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ?  that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings .  I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is .  perfect !  you have good fashion sense , Karen .  thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there .  yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . Susan ? What brings you here today ?  Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due .  Really ? So what ’ s the news ?  Not too good yet . Better than I was though . Hello , Mary .  Hello , Brian .  Here is my friend Bob .  Hello , Bob . Are you free tonight ?  Depends . Wanna chill out and watch cable ?  Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ?  It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials .  This show is like a black Friends .  BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV .  That's cool . I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable . My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ?  He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ?  He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office .  It must be hard being a father .  No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you .  Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day . So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ?  Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay .  Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there .  Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump .  Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can .  Ok , I ’ ll try my best . Where did you go yesterday ?  I went to play tennis in the public park .  How often do you play tennis ?  Twice a week . How about you ?  I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball .  But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .  I usually play with my schoolmates .  Do you like watching football matches ?  Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday . ... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast .

No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . I am having a hard time at my job .  What's wrong , Julia ?  My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore .  Don't give up so soon .  But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy .  Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from .  Tell that to my boss .  Do you know Abraham Lincoln ?  Yes .  He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States .  He was also assassinated because of his views .  He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit .  Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion .  That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ?  I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting .  So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? Hello !  Oh , hi !  Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom .  Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ?  Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ?  Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ?  No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ?  I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ?  I am an accountant at a company .  Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college .  It's nice meeting you too , Alice .  See you around !  Goodbye , Alice . Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card .  Sure , let me give you an application .

Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you . Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job .  Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job .  Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ?  That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch .  So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ?  Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits .  Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ?  Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care .  That ’ s a great employment benefit !  Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! He has come to life in the end .  Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him .  Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital .  Right . Unless , who know what will happen .  Wish him to be healthy soon . Harry , do you like the opera ?  No , not really .  Why is that ? It is called real art .  Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves .  Yeah , that makes sense . Lisa wins the first prize in the English speech contest of her college .  Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her .  But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning .  Honey , cheer up .  I feel confused about the grammars .  I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best .  And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated .  Be confident , and never give up .  I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad .  Keep your chin up . Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart .  Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . how did you do on your BELTS exam ?  fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight .  that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ?  yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .  do you know where the visa office is ?  no .  it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop .  that's not too far away . Do you think I'll get a visa ?  have you ever gone abroad before ?  yes , I've been to Tailband , Egypt , and Japan .  have you ever been denied a visa before ?  never .  that's good . Are you planning on immigrating to another country ?  no , I want to come back to China after I graduate .  that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear . Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ?  I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying .  I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want .  that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ?  I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ?  Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ?  No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ?  I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ?  I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles .  Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast .  Have you been to California ?  Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast .  How many kids do you have ?  Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now .  Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime . I dislike Susan . She is always above herself .  Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ?  What of it ?  Sure . Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ?  No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . What can I do for you ?  I ’ m returning these books .  Let me have them .  Here are all of them .  These books are two weeks late .  I didn ’ t have time to return them .  You ’ re going to have to pay late fees .  How much ?  25 cents a day .  25 cents a day ?  That means 25 cents for each late book .  That ’ s expensive . I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike .  That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot .  Well , I wish you good luck ! What shall we do after the volleyball match ?  How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .  That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .  Me , too . What did you have in mind ?  I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .  I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan  Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?  The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .  Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?  I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .  Any other ideas ?  There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .  It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . It is time to butter him up .  What do you have to do to grease the palm of him ?  I don ’ t know . Let me see .  You can go and ask your father . Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations !  Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true . Hello ?  Hi Vicky .  Are you there yet ?  Yes .  I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late .  That's no problem . I just wanted to tell you I'm inside .  Where are you ?  On the second floor .  Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ?  Come upstairs .  What ?  Oh , Can you hear me OK ? I said , come to the second floor .  Oh , OK . What are you doing there ?  Just looking at some books on how to learn English .  Do you want to get something to eat later ?  No , I'm still full from dinner .  What do you want to do ?  I don't know for sure . When you get here we'll talk about it .  OK , see you soon .  Bye . Who's that old lady trimming the trees ?  She's my grandma .  She looks very healthy.How old is she ?  92 . What do you think are the main causes of war today ?  I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force .  It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .  Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .  How do you think they could be ended ?  I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that .  So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .  It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .  Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .  The problem is that many poor people might suffer . Are you feeling better today , Bill ?  Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening .  You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health .  You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit .  But you should make up your mind first .  You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake .  Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work .  Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six .  In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time .  Ok . Goodbye .  See you later . Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ?  I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late .  What a pity ! The party is very interesting .  I have no choice . My mother is always very strict with me .  Don ’ t complain about it . She is concerned about your safety .  You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world . Steven , why are you so depressed ?  I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper .  What's the news ?  According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake .  It's horrible .  Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area .  Yes . How about donating some money ?  It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ?  Just find the answer through Internet .  Yes , let's do it now . I don ’ t know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has louse up my business several times .  You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ?  Yeah .  Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . Who's that over here ?  That's the new teacher .  What do you think of the teacher ?  She's very nice .  What does she teach ?  English , of course .  Is she your teacher ?  Yes.She teaches our class three times a week .  Can she speak Chinese to her students ?  Not very much .  It's a good thing you can speak English ! Judy , what is everybody talking about ?  Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager .  You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true .  Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company .  Really ? I ’ m surprised .  Me too . Hi , Mike . Haven't seen you for a while . How's Cathy ?  We are not seeing each other any more .  What happened ? Did you break up ?  Yeah . I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time .  Oh , I am sorry . Maybe you were just emotional at that moment . Do you think you guys can get back together ?  I don't know . There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea !  Oh , you are such a dog ! They're very good friends , aren't they ?  I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other .  Oh , it's unbelievable ! I went to Jessie's birthday party yesterday . It was very good .  I didn't know about it . What did you do ?  We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun .  You were really lucky .  My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too .  I hope I can go to your party . My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry .  After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ?  She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy .  I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life .  Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ?  No , why ?  My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her .  She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything .  She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ?  No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today .  I try to do that , but I can ’ t get up early enough .  I couldn ’ t either at first , but you get used to it .  It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning .  Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out .  I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ?  I ’ ll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty .  O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog .  Great , I ’ ll see you then .  See you . How's the weather today ?  It's cloudy .  Is it going to rain today ?  I doubt it .  But I heard it might rain . Well , the way you drive , Jen ... I still don't think that's a good idea .  I really love this music . It's a compilation .  I know . It's a mix of all the latest songs .  And you got them off the Net ?  No . I recorded these from your Cds .  Well , thanks for asking for my permission ... Now hand it over and let me record !  I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy ... Um , which of them is the better typist ?  Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully .  Is there any difference in their short hand ?  Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class .  How about languages ?  Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does .  Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . My friend George has been to Switzerland twice .  Does he like that country ?  Yes , he likes the people and the quietness there .  Would you ask him to tell us more about the country ? Hello , Ann ! Is that you ?  Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here .  It's been a long time ! What's new ?  Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ?  Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii .  How was it ?  I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up .  Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour .  Ok , I won't keep you then .  Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye !  Yes , stay in touch . Bye !  Give me your email , would you ?  Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye  Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down .  I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times .  Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know .  Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off .  Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness .  I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ...  Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one !  You are something else you know that ? Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door .  Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors .  I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly .  This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here .  Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors .  So , tell me , Karl , why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live ?  We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! Look ! It ’ s the start of the Olympic Games .  So what ?  You want to watch , don ’ t you ?  Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games .  Please yourself . The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ?  Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head  Why do you say so ?  He's always confused by easy questions . I can ’ t believe it !  What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal .  Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !  Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then .  I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .  What were the odds ?  20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !  Too bad . Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ?  Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work .  Oh , what about Saturday ? Are you free then ?  Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ?  What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ?  No , do you want to go and do something ?  Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner .  Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ? Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester .  Yes , of course . I need your student ID please .  Here you are .  Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ?  Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .  Sure.That ’ s not a problem.Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ?  Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .  Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ?  Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .  Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . Is your city a historical place ?  Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village .  How did it grow into such a large place ?  Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .  As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .  Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .  I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?  Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too .  Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ?  Two . French and Spanish .  And how well can you speak them ?  Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well .  And how about your Spanish ?  Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good .  I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here .  In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ?  Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers .  You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ?  I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old .  Oh you ’ re so kind !  Get in . Fred , can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone ?  Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone .  Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ?  Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here .  All information is filled in and now I can design my zone .  You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone .  Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ?  Certainly .  ( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ?  Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . Do you remember Tina , my good friend ?  Yes .  She just broke up with her boyfriend .  Well , that happens . I hope she is all right .  But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday .  That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case .  Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .  Oh where was that ?  I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .  Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .  Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?  She will be 86 next month .  That is truly amazing ! What time shall I pick you up ?  How about 6:30 ?  That'll be fine . See you soon . Hi , Zhengjun , what make you so happy .  You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company .  Oh , congratulations ! Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages .  Yes . I miss you very much .  So do I .  Have you graduated from college ?  Yes . I graduated last year and got a job in a press . Has the train come yet ?  No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages .  It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week .  Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train !  Yes , my customers have started to complain too !  Oh look ! Here it comes now ! I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me .  What's that ?  I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry .  Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ?  No , thank you .  That's the most important thing .  It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid .  Forget about it .  When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway .  Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well .  I appreciate that , thank you . Jenny is going to marry another man next month .  Yes , I know .  But , how can you be so calm . You loved her so much .  At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends . What's your favorite sport ?  Basketball , I'm a basketball fan . Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ?  Well , nothing special , reading , watching TV , walking , and so on .  Don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ?  No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ?  I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun .  Really ? How many collections do you have ?  So far I have more than 500 collections .  Among those collections , which is the most expensive ?  A set of ancient china . It is really invaluable . It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays .  Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week .  Cool ! What brand  A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart .  What about the quality ?  Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . It's four o'clock already . I hate to leave , but I think I must .  Can you stay a little longer ?  I'm sorry , but I can't . Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ?  Sorry , they are too busy these days .  How about this weekend ?  Yes , I think so . Happy Thanksgiving !  You , too .  Let's have pumpkin pie .  It's my favorite . Are you going anywhere for your vacation ?  Yes , we're making plans for a tour .  That'll be lovely . Where are you going ?  Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday .  Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then .  Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ?  It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too .  Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street .  So , you're going to have a really nice vacation .  You can say that again . Would you like to book a table , sir ?  Yes , would you arrange it for me the day after tomorrow ?  Sure , when ?  Six o'clock in the afternoon .  For how many guests , please ?  Six .  How much would you like to spend ?  We don't care about money . We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties .  OK .  How many courses are there altogether , please ?  Eight .  Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ?  Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices .  Very good . Did you watch TV last night , Rose ?  Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting .  What was it about ?  Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it .  If so , we may live there someday .  I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ?  Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists .  Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . How is your job search going , Janet ?  I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company .  Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !  Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job .  I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work .  I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted .  Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ?  I'm very sorry I can't .  Why not ?  I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business . Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet !  Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else .  You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report .  Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got .  It just happened to be the highest grade in the class .  You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it .  I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade .  If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ?  I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word .  I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ?  Yes , too good to be true . I was supposed to meet with you at half past one .  Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ?  There's a problem with my schedule .  What's the problem ?  Two of my classes occur at the same time .  Well , I can see that's a problem .  Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ?  Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ?  I want to keep both of them , if that's possible .  Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day .  Thanks a lot . I went bungee jumping yesterday .  That sounds like fun . Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ?  I think so . Why did you ask that ?  I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday .  Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ?  It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri .  In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world .  So you will come , won't you ?  Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival .  Thank you very much . What are you doing ?  What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ?  Mumm . no .  It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off .  What ?  The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all .  I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl .  This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals .  Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me .  Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good !  All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !  Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . We have absolute proof that you committed the crime .  That's absolutely ridiculous ! Where can I get the information , Kate ?  Ask John . He is sure to know about it .  Why ?  He has a finger in the pie . That was a tough question . How did you get it right ?  I just took a shot in the dark . There ’ s a letter here for you .  Let me see it .  What ’ s the letter about ?  It ’ s a letter from NYU .  Tell me what it says !  I didn ’ t get in .  You ’ re lying .  I ’ m not lying .  Are you upset ?  I had high hopes for NYU .  I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted .  Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ?  Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year .  Are you sure you can do well this year ?  I am 100 % certain .  According to what you did last time , I have my doubts .  I am sure I can get a 95 this time . What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?  I'm sorry . I forget all about it .  How could you ? I reminded you just this morning .  It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it .  I have been looking forward to this performance all month .  I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . Did you hear what happened to Mike last night ?  No , what ?  Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ?  Oh , no . What kind of trouble ?  Well , I don't know the details , but ... Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !  Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me .  What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ?  Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies .  Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that .  You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing !  Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive .  Yes . I dare say it will be .  It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed .  No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open .  But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money .  Mmm , you may be right .  Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ?  No . We couldn ’ t possibly .  Why not ?  It will be summer . So it will be hot .  Is that very likely in England ?  Yes . It could happen . Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas .  What did you have in mind ?  I don't know yet .  I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap .  I know what you mean .  I want to give a gift that is really meaningful .  Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them .  Or what only we are able to give them . Uh ... that's Greek to me .  That means they have tapered legs .  Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in .  Mine are , too .  So maybe we shouldn't go out after all .  Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ?  Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me .  Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb .  Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William .  Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! Mary is really a diligent girl .  What do you mean ?  She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months .  She is really something . Hello , this is David .  Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ?  Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ?  That will work .  Does five thirty work for you ?  That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time .  Is it the plans for my new house ?  Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .  Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .  How about the new bar across road ?  Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .  I agree , I had lunch there last week .  Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . I have an idea for Christmas this year .  What is it ?  Let's not exchange any gifts at all .  You big scrooge !  Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it !  But you may have some trouble convincing the kids .  Actual 1y , it was their idea first .  Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ?  Yes . Are you in his class ?  I'm thinking of taking his class next semester .  He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ?  Yes , I really need someone who is really good .  I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ?  Maybe , but I'm not sure .  Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ?  No , that stuff isn't important to me .  Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ?  I don't care about any of that .  We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you . Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ?  Uh ... what game ?  Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points !  Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ?  Football of course !  Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals .  No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer .  Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there .  So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ?  Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ?  Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football .  It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ?  Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?  It says a storm may come tomorrow .  Oh ! I hate rainy days !  Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ?  Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C .  What bad luck !  Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ?  Yeah , maybe you are right ! Where would you like to have your dinner ?  I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant .  You don't like Western food ?  I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste . Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone .  Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ?  No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there .  I'll bet you were a little embarrassed .  You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock .  Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two .  Thanks for telling me this .  I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying .  Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again .  Don't worry . We won't be the first . That ’ s really a let-down .  Yeah . He really does let me down .  But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart .  I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them .  Why not send them short messages ?  Can short messages reach them ?  Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them .  Why haven't I thought of this skill ?  I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge .  I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ?  I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . Hey , sorry to be late .  What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up .  My mother was ill . I had to look after her .  I ’ m so sorry to hear that . Hi ! How are you going ?  Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ?  Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time .  Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday .  Did you enjoy yourself ?  Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ?  Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day .  You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye .  Goodbye . My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face .  Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon .  How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one !  It spoiled my painting ! How annoying !  What's the matter ?  Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes .  Maybe there's something wrong with the program . I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender .  That ’ s open secret .  But mine could be a lie for his job .  How did you know that ?  A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . Who did the stupid thing ?  It must be Kate .  No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . Hello ?  Hi Tina , It's Joe .  Hi Joe .  How's the weather there today ?  It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early .  What's the temperature ?  It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning .  Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ?  I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow .  I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer .  Me too . How's the weather where you are ?  It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . Mike promised to help us .  Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ?  Why not ?  He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all . Hello , Ann ! Is that you ?  Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here .  It's been a long time ! What's new ?  Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ?  Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii .  How was it ?  I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up .  Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour .  Ok , I won't keep you then .  Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye !  Yes , stay in touch . Bye !  Give me your email , would you ?  Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . Tom , I've got good news for you .  What is it ?  Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ?  Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize !  You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you .  Thanks for the compliment .  You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate ! Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ?  I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick .  Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it .  I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family .  Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it .  I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out .  OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !  You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ?  Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ...  Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday .  Which flight ?  Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers .  How about the passengers ?  Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ?  I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared .  Why ?  Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe .  Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already .

Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy .  how about recycling ? Does that actually help ?  yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .  what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?  I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .

I thought you wanted to know more about her .  No , I couldn't care less ! hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?  oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .  what ' the matter ?  the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .  I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .  yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .  that's true .  anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?  it was good . I brough lunch from home today .  you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .  well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy .  i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .  yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ?  you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .  well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .  seriously ?  yeah , it's hard to believe but true . What's your favorite TV Program ?  I like variety shows .  I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor .  I prefer a variety show without a host . What's up ? You look low .  It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game .  How come ?  I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again .  I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart .  Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ?  Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery .  Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems .  The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound .  Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks .  I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good .  The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ?  It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive .  His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . Happy New Year , Bill .  Happy New Year , Steven .  Do you have any plans for the New Year holiday ?  My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting . What about you ?  How happy you are ! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam . Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her .  I don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me .  And do you really love her ?  I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl . A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine .  That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him .  He must be regretting about having done the business .  I bet he is . He domed his own life . I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue .  He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ?  It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now .

I've used all mine .  Here . Are you all right ?  Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache .  I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor .  No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining .  Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest .  I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on .  You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever .  Do I ? Oh , no .  Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ?  What about Mr.White ?  I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work .  Thanks a lot , Eve . Goodbye . How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ?  Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films .  We could find a classical one .  That sounds fine . You are in love with Mary , right ?  You are pulling my legs !  I am not blind . Anyone can see that with half an eye . I'm going on a cruise this summer .  No kidding ?  My brother won a free trip and he's taking me .  You can't beat that . Where do you spend the weekend ?  We've a country house .  That's nice .  Join us , will you ?  That'd be great ! Thank you . How's your work ?  Good , thanks . How about you ?  Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately .  Why ?  Because of the low salaries .  But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ?  I don't know why .  Why don't you give them a suggestion ?  May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . Good morning , Linda . How have you been ?  Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it .  I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ?  No , thanks .  Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon .  Thank you for your concern . Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend ?  I'm not really into racecar driving .  You were when we were in high school . That , and baseball .  Yeah , well , times change . Look at you-you're a father now . You can't say that you haven't changed .  True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now .  I mean , I know spring training's over , but I'm just not into all that .  Hello ? Is the real Taylor in there ? How do you feel ?  I'm nervous as can be . I can't believe it ! I lost .  It looks like you have to buy tickets for us , Jason . And we're not going to see an action movie !  That's not fair , you got all the easy questions .  I guess that's just the luck of the draw .  I want a rematch . Let's play again .  Sorry , not tonight ! do you need a hand ?  no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway .  are you sure you don't need any help ?  well , maybe just a little .

I'm in the middle seat .  oh , I guess I'll let you through then .  thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again .  that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ?  no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ?  I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away .  I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours .  thanks a lot . That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ?  that would be great . thanks . Are you listening to me , Dan ?  I'm with you , Jane .  What did I just say ?  Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part .  Just what I thought ! Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me !  Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ?  I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet !  What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !  I know . I know !  Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it !  You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !  Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?  I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .  How come ?  It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't .  I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?  Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . Who's that over here ?  That's the new teacher .  What do you think of the teacher ?  She's very nice .  What does she teach ?  English , of course .  Is she your teacher ?  Yes . She teaches our class three times a week .  Can she speak Chinese to her students ?  Not very much .  It's a good thing you can speak English ! The teacher just canceled the test .  Are you kidding ? Hello ?  Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ?  Oh , hi . I was just watching TV .  There's nothing to watch right now .  I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored .  Me too . Let's get together and do something .  I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ?  Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow .  Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?  I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny .  That's great . We can do something outdoors then .  Are there any special events going on tomorrow ?  Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow .  Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out .  Do you know what time it starts ?  It starts at one PM .  Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there .  Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty . Would you go to the bookstore with me ?  It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go .  Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ?  Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels .  So what are you interested in ?  Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian .  I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular .  Yes . I can lend you some .  Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ?  Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister .  Well ... How about Friday then ?  That sounds fine .  Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ?  I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ?  That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you .  I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday ! I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday .  Really ? Do I look happy all the time ?  All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers .  Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive !  Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you .  Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring .  It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week .  But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?  Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ?  Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first .  Oh , I know . Thank you . Which kind of sport do you like to watch ?  Basketball , football , table tennis . I will watch them on TV .  So you must like NBA game .  Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA .  What kind of sport do you like to participate in ?  I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ?  I prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash .  Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . '  How about playing tennis with me ?  Good idea . I will take the racket . Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ?  Fine , just fine.Thanks .  Doing anything for lunch ?  Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ?  Of course . Are you a new member here ?  Yes .  Welcome . My name is Johnson .  Nice to meet you .  Do you have any experience using weights ?  No , I don't . So I need some help .  Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines .  Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines .  Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you .  What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one .  No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you .  I'm ready .  Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .  I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress .  Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you .  Alright . Great .  So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here .  Great . Why don't we start on the machines ?  Are you alright ? Can you do more ?  I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted .  That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning .  What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines .  We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ?  Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . Don't be afraid . Give it a try .  Okay . what are you doing ?  I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .  you really like brains that make you think , don't you ?  I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ?  I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at !  Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ?  Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours .  Did you play a lot of games when you were little ?  My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend .  Do you still like playing those games ?  Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ?  Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games .  Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ?  No , I prefer to play with people I know .  How about mah-jong ?  It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it .  I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong !  I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful .  Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled .  I hope so . They got a divorce at last .  It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .  You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .  That give us a good lesson . Do you like traveling , Kathy ?  I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ...  Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving .  Exactly . Can you believe that Susan got married ?  Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ?  No . That ’ s what is surprising me .  You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man .  He ’ s a postman .  I thought she would marry a fortune . What sort of things do you grow in your garden ?  I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round .  When is your garden at its best ?  It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . Good afternoon !  Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?  I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?  Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?  Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .  Yes .  What's the weather like in your country ?  Mm ... It's quite warm now .  Where do you live ?  In London.Where do you live ?  Here.Near this school . Oh , no ! Now I'll be late .  Can I give you a hand ?  Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown .  Sure thing . I've got time . What a great weekend that was !  My feelings exactly .  I really enjoy the beach in the summer .  I couldn't agree with you more .  We should come here more often .  You are absolutely right .  I'd like to come back next weekend .  That's exactly the way I feel . What's this , I wonder ?  I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder .  A coffee grinder ?  Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans .  Oh , that would be very useful . We've got a new manager in our department .  Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ?  Yes , I did .  I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ?  Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too  Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ?  Because I'm the wrong sex , of course !  You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ?  Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair .  What sort of clothes does he wear ?  A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ?  Perhaps that had something to do with it .  You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ?  It's possible , isn't it ?  Do you really think I should wear different clothes ?  Well . . . perhaps you should think about it .  Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ?  I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all !  Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing !  Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . It's a sunny day , isn't it ?  Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you .  My name is David . Nice to meet you , too .  Are you American ?  No , I'm a Britisher . Where do you come from ?  I come from America . Are you a freshman ?  Yes . What about you ?  Me , too .  Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends .  Yeah . Anytime . You keep bowling spares but no strike .  I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball .  I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands .  Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ?  The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares .  Really ? I will try again . Nice to see you , Patrick .  Bob ! I hear your team won the match .  Yeah . All of us tried our best .  Congratulations !  Thanks . Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon ?  No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ?  I'm sorry . I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then .  What about the next day ?  No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ?  Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant .  Good idea ! Is two o'clock okay ?  That's fine . See you there ! Did you enjoy the movie ?  Oh , it's really a drag .  Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond .  Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ?  It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out .  Why ? What's stressing you out ?  School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out .  The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright .  I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take .  I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other .  That will be great . The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format .  Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ...  The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ...  What changes were made from the old page to the new page ?  First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ...  Great ! Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ?  Are you sure ? How do you know ?  Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better !  Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ?  Sure , here you are .  Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?  Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better .  Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .  Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy .  Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes .  I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt .  Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . '  Exactly . Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you .  Thank you . And a merry Christmas to you ! Could you lend your bike to me for several days ?  How long would you like to keep it ?  Till the end of the week .  Yes , that'd be all right . Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ?  Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ...  Did they mutiny ?  Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened .  It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them .  Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... How about a game of tennis ?  Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month .  It's a deal .  See you in the court . Are you feeling better today , Bill ?  Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening .  You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health .  You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit .  But you should make up your mind first .  You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake .  Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work .  Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . Hi , John , how was your vacation ?  Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand .  That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?  Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia .  Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ?  A little , but the rush was worth it .  Tell me about it .  We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .  500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .  Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . What did her boss say to you ?  He asked me to beef up in the work .  Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter .  Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . Hi , Tina , it's Joe .  Hi , Joe .  What's the weather like there today ?  It's really cold . It snowed all day and the school closed early .  What's the temperature ?  It's 20 degrees below zero now . It was even colder this morning .  Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ?  I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow .  I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer .  Me too . How's the weather where you are ?  It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ?  Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original .  Thanks .  I can tell you worked hard on it .  I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago .  Well , it was definitely worth all the time .  Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . How about doing shopping this weekend ?  What're you going to buy ?  Sportshoes.Will you go with me ?  OK . Merry Christmas !  Huh ?  I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ?  It is ? Oh , that's nice .  Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ?  Actually , I'd forgotten about it .  Forgotten about it ? How could you ?  Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish .  Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know .  It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian .  I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ?  Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break .  Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ?  Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . It's all over . I'm bankrupt .  Don't worry . Everything will be fine . Bill , Happy Halloween !  Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ?  I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs .  May I have a look at your costume ?  Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are .  I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool .  I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood .  Haha . Wish you good luck . I think that ’ s settled .  I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are !  How dare you speak to me like this .  Why not ? Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend .  Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach .  That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?  Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there .  So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously .  I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down .  Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ?  I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees .  It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that .  It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ?  The brain !  That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ?  The heart !  Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ?  The stomach and intestines !  Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ?  Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder !  Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed .  So what do these organs do , teacher ?  Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . It's not good for business recently .  Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities .  Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . Do you know how to play go ?  It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory .  But I heard it is very difficult to play .  It's easier said than done . When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages !  Hi George ! It's good to see you !  What have you been up to ?  I just opened up my own business not long ago .  Good for you ! What are you doing ?  I'm a professional party planner here in the city . I do catering and all that .  I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun !  Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun ! So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?  Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .  That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .  Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .  Did you buy new cupboards too ?  No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .  I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .  Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .  Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food .  Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food .  Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket .  I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! How do you like skiing , Pat ?  I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year .  I suppose skiing is easy for you .  No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better .  I see . Do you ski often ?  Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night .  That sounds great .  Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ?  Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg  Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . Hi , Dave . This is Zina .  Zina ? Zina the Snake ?  I got your e-mail a couple of months back .  Yeah ? Which one was that ?  The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep .  Right . That one . Did it work ? Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight .  Yes , what can I do for you ?  I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans .  I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ?  OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ?  Certainly .  Thank you very much .  That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye .  Good-bye . Can I use your laptop for a while ?  Sure , go ahead .  Oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ?  Yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around .  Oh my , no internet access is killing me .  Can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like .  No , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends .  Now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation .  What does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me .  Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web .  That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy .  Then , you're probably addicted . Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking .  I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ?  I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .  I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight .  It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .  You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . Tell me something about your Valentine's Day .  Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return .  So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun .  Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? What will happen to the children if you break up ?  That's a relief for me and a misery for the children .  Why don't you make up with John .  It's too late . Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall .  Yeah , I've been there twice .  Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ?  Oh , it's fantastic .  Where did you go ?  On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto .  What did you think of Tokyo ?  Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too .  Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds !  And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive .  And how about Kyoto ?  Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city .  How was the weather ?  I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity .  Sounds perfect . I can't wait ! Where do you live now ?  I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities .  Which street do you live on ?  I live at No . 50 Xingu Street . Who did the stupid thing ?  Maybe it was Dick .  I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .  Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . Can I help you ?  Yes . I'd like to borrow these books .  Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you .  Thanks .  Here you are . You must return them within a month .  What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ?  You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them .  OK.Thank you very much for your trouble .  No trouble at all . So long . Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ?  Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ?  Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work .  I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ?  Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good .  Which one is that ?  You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door .  Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good .  Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ?  What time ?  At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation .  That's good . See you on Friday . Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?  No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?  Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant .  What was that like ?  It was always very busy there .  What did you do ?  I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .  Did you get any perks on the job ?  Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . Did you like the play ?  Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either .  You're absolutely right . The acting could be better .  To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . I need some books on hardware .  There's many books here.What about these ?  Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ?  Sure.But you can only keep them for a week .  I see.Thank you . I don ’ t know why I married him .  What is the matter ?  He never see eye to eye with me .  That is to say , love is blind . Why is the long face ?  I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more .  Did you just get your review or something ?  Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long .  That sucks .  I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies .  Look on the bright side . At least you have a job .  Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it .  Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight .  How about a cold bottle of beer .  Now you're talking . You're so witty ...  So why is the face tilted to the right ?  This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand .  So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ?  It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time .  I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ...  Bingo ! Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ?  I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out .  What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ?  Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st .  That's fine . I want 2 tickets . Does Tom drink a lot ?  Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .  That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . Do you offer a course in business management ?  Yes , we do .  How many nights a week is it ?  It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday .  And how long does the course last ?  It lasts for 9 months .  When does it start ?  The next beginning class starts on October 25th .  What time is the class ?  From 7 to 9 o'clock .  How much does it cost ?  It costs 125 dollars a month .  Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course .  Thank you , please fill out this form for us .  Do you want me to fill it out now ?  Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences . How many passengers are there aboard the ship ?  Seventy-six , I think . What ’ s your schedule like this year ?  Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year .  What ’ s your major ?  I ’ m majoring in French literature .  Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long .  That ’ s right . We got the assignment last week .  When is it due ?  Next Monday !  Remind me never to sign up for that course ! Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ?  Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ?  Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world .  If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure !  My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that !  Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ?  If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! Something wrong ?  Yes . My car is having problems .  What's wrong ?  It won't start .  Do you want me to take a look ?  No , thank you . I think I can handle it .  Well , if you change your mind , let me know .  I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you .  No problem .  I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ?  Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you .  Thanks . That would be very helpful .  Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping .  OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ?  I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it .  It's really very easy saying you're sorry .  Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ?  I suppose I do .  The climate here is pleasant .  They use said it  This city is really comfortable to living .  It sure is  No other city can match it . It's heaven .  Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much .  Maybe .  That's for sure . Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ?  Yeah , I know .  I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house .  I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself !  That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent .  It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own .  They see their independence as a kind of character strength .  Sometimes they are too independent . How are you making out ?  I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself .  I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift .  Don't mention it . Happy Birthday , Mary !  Thank you .  Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it .  What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ?  I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt .  Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother .  Really ? It looks so nice .  Thank you . Please have a cup of tea .  All right .  How about some fish ?  No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake .  OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ?  No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary .  It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . How did you meet your girlfriend ?  I met Amanda through a friend .  That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ?  We started dating right away . Is there anything available for tonight ?  There are some seats in the rear mezzanine .  Isn't there anything else available ?  No , the show is almost sold out . I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ?  He's not doing too well .  Why ? What's wrong ?  About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time .  Is it due to old age or is he sick .  Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth .  That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life .  That's what my father tells me almost everyday .  Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me .  Thanks . I'll let him know . Wedding rings !  Oh , no ...  Aren't they cool ? I like the settings .  Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ?  No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ?  Women are such dreamers .  These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! Hurry up , get in .  I ’ m in , let ’ s go !  OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up !  Geez ! What ’ s the rush ?  Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it !  Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light !  Whatever . Just turn right here . . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move !  What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help !  Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady !  I ’ m going as fast as I can !  Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes .  You ’ re such a geek ! I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ?  Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ?  Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ?  Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ?  Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ?  Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ?  No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ?  The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ?  Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ?  Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ?  No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ?  Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it .  He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you .  Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me .  Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?  I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .  How come ?  It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't .  I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?  Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . Maybe we'd better go now .  It's still early .  Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like .  Since we're late , let's go to see a film .  OK.Hurry up . My uncle passed away last night .  My condolences . Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ?  Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ?  I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind .  Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ .  Why ? You seem pretty sure about it .  Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life .  But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it .  That's why people's achievement varies greatly .  That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them .  Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ?  I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives .  Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ?  Just as Forrest ?  Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ .  I got it . Come on ! It's time to go !  Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?  Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first .  That won't take long .  Well , it won't if there no line at the pump .  Well , I'm not quite ready .  I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !  You wouldn't do a thing like that !  Oh , yes , I would ! How's business ?  So so . Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick .  Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything .  Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .  I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative .  I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .  You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore  Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .  Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories .  Love stories ? More like one-night-stands .  Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints .  My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ?  You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . Which language do you speak ?  Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ?  Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet .  How do you find studying a language on the internet ?  It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good .  I bet you find the character difficult to write !  Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me .  So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ?  Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ?  In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?  Sorry , I thought you knew .  But you should tell me you were in love with her .  Didn't I ?  You know you didn't .  Well , I am telling you now .  Yes , but you might have told me before .  I didn't think you would be interested .  You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .  Oh , you men ! You are all the same . So , did you go out with Richard ?  Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II .  Did you like it ?  Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it .  Yeah . So did you do anything else ?  Well , we went to a dance club .  Did you have fun there ?  Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ?  I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market .  So you will continue to study for a master's degree ?  Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home .  How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad .  I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship .  It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... It's hard to get tickets for the movie .  Did you get any ?  Yeah , two at the tenth rows .  How much is the ticket ?  3.5 dollars each . What a great weekend that was !  My feeling's exactly .  I really enjoy the beach in the summer .  I couldn't agree with you more .  We should come here more often .  You are absolutely right .  I'd like to come back next weekend . I think Andy's party will be fun .  Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something .  What's that ?  Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?  Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ?  My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy .  I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies .  Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ?  They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts !  I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic .  Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs .  Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard .  I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers .  The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ?  Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now .  Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ?  Why not ? I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday .  If you would like me to , I could help you with that .  Wouldn't that take you away from your project ?  I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me .  Is there a good time for you to help me ?  If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday .  How about meeting in my office ?  That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have .  Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot .  Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise ! If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ?  Why ? Did tom pop the question ?  Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent .  Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ?  You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place .  I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex .  Oh , how did you deal with it ?  I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up .  Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ?  Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences .  Like what ?  He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family .  Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first .  Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working .  So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .  Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . Where is Tom ?  He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .  What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ?  He ran four miles and came back dead beat .  Oh , I see . Hi , Ann .  Hi . You look excited . What's happening ?  I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days .  And you're planning to enter ?  Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice .  Is there a prize ?  I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio .  Do you think you have a chance ?  A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful .  But you haven't practised all that much .  I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag !  Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help .  Yeah , maybe . I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow .  OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep .  Good night . See you tomorrow . I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little .  That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ?  Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?  Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it .  I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . What day is today ?  Today is Thursday .  What's the date today ?  Today is May first , 2003 .  Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ?  Well , I don't think so . Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ?  That would be fine . Where are you going ?  We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing .  Great .  And don't forget your fishing tackle .  Ok . I like fishing very much . Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ?  The same question to you .  Well , we shall make it a secret between us .  Deal , Where is Gucci ?  She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come .  Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA .  I want to be like her .  Get real . Don't be so pathetic .  Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that .  Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis .  Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ?  Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie .  Are you out of your mind ?  She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool .  Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . You know John ?  Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ?  Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper .  And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam .  I wish he could too .  How ’ s your boy , Jack ?  He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .  Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ?  Good luck to them . You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish .  No , thanks . I have had enough .  What about some drink ?  Please bring me a cup of coffee . Good morning . I want to apply for a library card .  Give me 10 yuan , your ID card and a photo of you please .  But I hear that the card is free .  Yes , it is . But you must pay a deposit for the card .  There will be a refund when I return the card , right ?  Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches .  OK , here you are . I am very proud of John .  Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business .  But he has suffered a lot . What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ?  Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it .  I think they will . What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ?  To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them .  You're becoming a real television watcher .  A lot of people feel the same way . May I invite you for a dance ?  With pleasure .  You dance well . Do you breakdance ?  Me , what brought that on ?  There's a story about breakdancing in the paper .  What does it say ?  According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style .  Like disco ?  Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance .  And disco a kind of nightclub .  Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ...  So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether .  You are witty . Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ?  That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ?  It is in the hotel ballroom down the street .  Do you need it for the whole weekend ?  We will need it for both days .  We will need to know who will be driving the van .  The van will be driven by Mary and me .  It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ?  Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom .  Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening . Guess who I saw yesterday ?  I don't know . Who ?  Avril Lavigen !  the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?  yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ...  so you're a big fan , eh ?  not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too .  and she was in a movie once again , right ?  yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great .  what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?  she looked sweeter than her pictures .  did you take a photo with her ?  no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs .  crazy ! Can you lend me fifty bucks ?  What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ?  I guess I don't earn enough .  No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem .  That's my business , not yours .  True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important .  So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ?  I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises .  I'm not disciplined enough I guess .  In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?  I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line .  I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .  If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .  How would you do that ?  I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much .  I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .  I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .  The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular .  That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . What day is today ?  Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two .  Oh , The day after tomorrow is Christmas .  Merry Christmas to you . You ’ re new here , right ?  Yes , I am .  Will this be your first year ?  No , I transferred here .  What school did you come from ?  I transferred from PCC .  Why ’ d you transfer here ?  I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough .  Is PCC a good school ?  PCC is great !  I hope you enjoy it here .  Thank you very much . The bridegroom looks a bit nervous .  On this occasion , most people do .  Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come .  She is a beautiful bride .  I am so happy for them .  Are you crying ?  Yes , I always cry at weddings .  Harris and Anne are perfect for each other .  Yes , they are .  You and Tom also make a great couple .  In fact , we are beginning to make preparations .  For the wedding ?  No , no , for the engagement .  Try to catch this bouquet then . Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue .  is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ?  yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful .  I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ?  I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last .  yeah , that's nice .  hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home .  a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ?  I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .  I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . Have you got your invitation yet ?  My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?  The house warming party .  Whose house warming party is it ?  Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .  Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .  It's out in the suburbs .  Have you seen the house ?  Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .  Is it nice ?  Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden .  Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?  They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .  When are they going to have the party ?  Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .  Wow , that would be something to look forward to . Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ?  Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .  I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .  I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .  Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?  Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air .  I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ?  why not ? I love animals and I love nature .  You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun .  sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there .  Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here .  That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing .  I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm .  Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try .  I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first .  Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ?  Of course . I will .  Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun .  It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider .  No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . how are you doing ?  I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend .  what happened to him ?  he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .  was it his first offence ?  unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university .  what happened to him then ?  not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 .  did they take his license away ?  no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now .  what do you think will happen to him ?  well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail .  that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ?  not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one .  my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him .  that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . Well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant .  Is that so ? I didn't know it.Can I possible borrow a jacket and a tie ?  I'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie .  Then we return to the hotel and come back.Will you change the appointment ?  Certainly.What time will you come back ?  At seven , please .  How many in your party ?  A party of three .  All right.We are waiting for you at seven . You know Ernie , it seems we both like the same artists .  Yes , we do . I think we have the same musical tastes .  But if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance . Can you do that ?  I'm not a very good singer , but I'm a really great dancer ! I love hip hop dancing .  Great ! I'll sing , and you can dance in our band . I wish I had access to the public library .  it's easy ! Just go and get a card . Are you ready ?  Not yet . Is this your brother-in-law ?  Yes , he married my sister ten years ago .  From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character .  Yes , my sister loves his personality . You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?  I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .  Where did you spend your holiday ?  I went to Paris . Our team just scored a goal .  That's more like it .  Tell me about it .  They might actually win the game . Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ?  Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy .  What are you doing ?  I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month .  What kind of volunteer work ?  I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities .  Oh , yeah ?  Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . Tom , is Jenny crying ?  Can you take he away from me ?  I ’ m just coming for that .  She kept on bothering me .  She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ?  But I am her brother , not her servant . You ’ re making my blood boil .  Calm down . Madam .  I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter .  I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems .  Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ?  I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out .  Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough !  If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . Can you tell me something about financial aid ?  What exactly ?  How to apply for it ?  In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid .  Then ...  If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid .  What if not ?  They will tell you the aid is impossible . How was Mei ’ s party on Saturday ?  Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family .  Oh really ? What did you do ?  We watched lots of television and films .  I see . Anything else ?  Yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine .  Well , it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself . What's the temperature today ?  It's about 5 degrees centigrade .  What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?  The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow .  Are you used to the climate here ?  I think I'll soon get used to it .  What is the average temperature of Beijing ?  lt's about 180C , but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero . And we have a long winter .  Which season do you like best ?  I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice . I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that .  But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z .  However , he disappointed us very much this time .  I can understand that . But ... Kelly , the guys and I think you should run for senior class president .  Me ? Why me ? Why not you ?  We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about .  And you think I fit the qualifications ?  Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate .  Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ?  Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president .  I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first . Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ?  I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today .  Well . You'd better take a hot shower right now , or you will catch a cold .  I know . I don't want to get sick , especially during finals week . Why are those people crying ?  They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day .  Tomb Sweeping Day ? What is it ?  Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead .  What do they do ?  People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead . Er ... Alison ?  Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ...  I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win .  Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ...  It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really !  Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . Why aren't you at work ?  I called in sick . How is the college search going ?  It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do .  But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ?  It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ...  I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ...  Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low .  I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended .  Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for .  Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?  I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ?  Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .  Which is better ?  One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers .  I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools .  Yeah , sometimes . Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class .  Is this something that you could schedule for another time ?  No , I have to do this ; it's important !  Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ?  I've made arrangements with a friend to help me .  You know that I only allow one absence per semester , don't you ?  Yes , I know .  Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me .  OK , I can do that .  Well , have a good day off from class . It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you .  Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ...  This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ...  I'll tell you all about it another day .  But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ?  You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !  Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .  On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .  As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .  I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect .  What is the greenhouse effect exactly ?  It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .  I see , so it's similar to global warming ?  They're related to one another , yes .  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .  People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .  People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .  I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . What would you like to do tonight ?  I'm not sure .  What about going to a movie ?  OK , let's go to the cinema to see what's on . Mary , be calm .  It is impossible . You cheated on me .  No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you .  Shut up !  No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ...  But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't .  OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same .  Leave me ! Go away ! Would you mind doing something for me ?  I would if I could .  Would you please explain the meaning of the word ?  Yes , With pleasure . Our maths teacher is rather humorous .  On the contrary , I think he's very serious .  No , not at all.His examples are really interesting .  So they're easy to remember .  Yeah , how about your maths teacher ?  He's an old antique , very serious .  Bad luck , Anne .  Hey ! How about your history teacher ?  She's another antique .  I'm sorry to hear that . Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ?  Sounds good . What should we see ?  How about that European movie ?  You mean the one starring John Travolta ?  Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding .  Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday .  Okay , see you then . Could you do me a favor ?  What is it ?  Could you possibly give me a lift home ?  All right .  Are you sure ? I don't want to inconvenience you .  No problem . I'd be happy to .  Thanks . I really appreciate it . Thanks so much . I have an appointment for half past one .  What can I help you with ?  Well , I have a problem with my class schedule .  What is it ?  It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time .  I can understand the problem with that .  Is there any way that you can fix my schedule ?  No problem , do you want those classes still ?  Yes , I do .  Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day .  Thank you very much . It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy .  Are you sure of that ?  I am not certain about that .  They may have some difficulty in doing it . Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ?  So I hear .  Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary .  After all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . She must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back . Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ?  The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages .  Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ?  There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l  Are the reports favorable ?  Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a  That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ?  Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week .  I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them .  Sure . There you are . Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ?  That would be terrible .  Sure thing . I have an experience like that .  Oh , how were you saved finally ?  I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . I am looking for some information about home stay .  Well , I have been in a host home before . During my first year in the us , I stayed with a family . They are nice .  How did you pay them ?  Well , that depends . If you stay for a long time . They will offer a discount . He followed me all the way home !  That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .  Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?  Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .  Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !  Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .  I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .  Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .  Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . What's your favorite book ?  It's Gone With the Wind .  Why do you like it best ?  I enjoy the various characters and the plot .  Well . I like the Thorn Birds best .  Is it very interesting ?  Sure . I like the writer's language , too .  If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .  Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?  That's a good idea . Let's go ! May I help you ?  I would like to check out these books .  May I see your library card , please ?  Yes . Here you go .  Apparently , you have unpaid late fees .  I do ?  You owe some money .  Exactly how much do I owe ?  You owe $ 24.50 .  I won ’ t be able to pay that right now .  Until you pay it , you can ’ t check out books .  I will pay it . Don ’ t worry . How did you choose courses when you were abroad ?  That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor .  Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you .  Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation .  Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there .  Sure , very difficult .  I am very grateful for your advice .  It's my pleasure to talk with you . So it is hard to be a black student on campus ?  Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life .  Stereotypes ? Like what ?  Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well .  I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball .  Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma .  You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy .  I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well .  Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all .  Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion .  I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . Could you help me ?  What do you need ?  I can't seem to find my class .  What building is it in ?  It's in the C building .  Oh , I know exactly where that is .  Do you think you can tell me where it is ?  Sure , what room number is it ?  It's room number 261 .  I have a class around there right now .  Could you show me where it is ?  No problem , come on . John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ?  Yes , I watched once .  What do you think of it ?  Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form .  I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan .  Really ? Good for you . Let ’ s play a game !  OK ! How about Scrabble ?  No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is !  OK !  Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !  Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !  Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !  Your future husband !  Not funny . Hi Julie , how are things going ?  Everything is great , Tad . How are you ?  I'm doing really well .  Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ?  Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ?  That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee .  I thought that he was with Malia .  Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday .  I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that !  Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable .  I was not born yesterday . So , Emily , how was your day ?  I don't think you really want to hear about it .  It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .  To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !  Why ? What happened ?  Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !  That's not very fair . What did you do ?  There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure .  Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?  He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !  Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?  I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !  Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?  Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .  That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders .  I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .  That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . Can you speak English ?  Yes I can . I speak it very well .  Where did you learn it ?  I lived in England when I was a child .  What else can you speak ?  Well , I know a little Italian . Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ?  About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything .  You know , about David and new boss .  Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you .  Well , I hear David have been fired .  Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . How would you describe your relationship with our boss ?  We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot .  What do you think his strengths are ?  Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . Which school is your children in ?  She is now in a private school .  Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school .  It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools .  But the private school amount to better schools . I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it .  How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ?  It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters .  That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ?  Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once .  If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . I really like the record you lent me the other day .  I'm glad you like it .  And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .  Not at all .  I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it .  I'm glad .  Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? We'd like to have a look around your house ?  Yes , of course , please follow me .  Thank you .  This is our courtyard .  It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ?  Yes , about 46 square metres .  Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ?  Yes .  Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ?  They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time .  Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ?  Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand .  You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ?  Actually it will be my first time to meet her .  You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her .  That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month .  Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast .  The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way .  Probably you ’ re right . Hi ! Susan ! I haven't seen you for ages !  I've been really busy . How is everything ?  Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?  Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing .  It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels .  There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect .  Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes .  And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier .  You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows .  What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you !  Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! Hello  Hi Angela , it's Dan .  Hi B . How are you ?  Good .  I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ?  Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off .  No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ?  Oh , is that next week ?  Yes . Did you forget ?  No , of course not . I already bought them a present .  That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me .  Sure . Does she know your friend ?  Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other .  Are we all going to drive together ?  Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home !  Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ?  What do you mean ?  I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet .  But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money .  Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ?  Pyramid scheme ? What is that ?  It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .  Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him .  Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom .  What happens then ?  Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam .  I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ?  Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine .  While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator .  You sure have a lot of discs here .  Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff .  To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ?  Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me .  Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?  Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter .  How about Sunday then ?  Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?  Does 6,30 suit you ?  It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then .  Thanks , goodbye . I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains .  I agree , I think that that would be perfect !  I was thinking it could take place sometime in January .  That might be a little too cold for some people .  Yes , you are right .  What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot .  Yes , that would work out better .  You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone .  Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it .  Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! How may I help you ?  I need to check these books out .  Do you have your library card ?  Here it is .  It appears that you have late fees .  Really ?  Yes , really .  How much do I owe ?  You owe $ 24.50 in late fees .  I don ’ t have that much today .  I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books .  I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible . Merry Christmas !  Huh ?  I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ?  It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice .  Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ?  Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it .  Forgotten about it ? How could you ?  Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish .  Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know .  It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian .  I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ?  Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break .  Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ?  Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . Do you want to go shopping with me ?  That's a good idea.What time is good for you ?  How about Saturday morning ?  Sounds good . Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before .  Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card .  Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever .  It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market .  It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ?  Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ?  That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up .  I am still young . And I'm growing every minute .  Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope .  I love running . Anything else ?  Please change your clothes first !  I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me .  Sorry , but no jeans here .  Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members .  Really ? Can I join it ?  Of course you can if you like it .  How can I join it ?  There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then .  OK , thank you . Is that girl your girlfriend ?  No , it's not .  She doesn't look like our classmate .  Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister .  Really , she's so pretty . What do you do in summer ?  I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ?  I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book .  What do you do in winter ?  Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter .  I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter .  Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !  Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ?  Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! Happy new year !  Thank you . Same to you .  Have you got any plans ?  I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ?  My roommate ’ s having a party . Do you offer a course in business management ?  Yes , we do .  How many nights a week is it ?  It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday .  And how long does the course last ?  It lasts for 9 months .  When does it start ?  The next beginning class starts on October 25th .  What time is the class ?  From 7 to 9 o'clock .  How much does it cost ?  It costs 125 dollars a month .  Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course .  Thank you , please fill out this form for us .  Do you want me to fill it out now ?  Yes , please . we need a record of you education and your work experiences . Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?  I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets .  How would you solve the problem ?  I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .  It would probably be very expensive .  I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i  It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .  If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters .  Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .  The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .  Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ?  No , I'm scared of cats .  Oh , but why ?  I feel they're dirty . Would you like to see our new shirts ?  Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things .  Well , they are very nice you know .  Really ?  And not expensive either .  Oh , I don't care about that .  Everybody is buying them .  Are they ?  Yes , they are very fashionable , you see .  I am afraid I am not interested in fashion .  I see .  But thank you very much all the same .  Sorry I couldn't help you . Come in , come in !  Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?  I thought we were supposed to meet HERE .  Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .  I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .  Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?  You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie .  It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . how was school today , Dominic ?  I hate school !  why ? What happened ?  I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today !  it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ?  yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed !  why didn't you do a good job ?  I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank .  do you think you studied enough for the exam ?  no ...  what did you do last night ?  I watched TV .  did you study at all last night for your exam ?  no , not really .  I am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ?  tomorrow .  alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare . I haven't met the Smiths for a long time .  They have moved to Chicago .  Why ?  Mr.Smith has changed his job . Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days .  Why ? What's eating her ?  Love sick . You know who she's in love with ?  I don't have the slightest idea .  Someone you're living with .  What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ?  Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack .  No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl .  The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him .  And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection .  Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it . Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ?  Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it .  Better luck this time ! How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ?  At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me !  Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too .  It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied .  Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff .  Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine .  Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ?  No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch .  But you didn't eat anything today .  Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant .  All right . I'm going to the McDonald's .  For what ? I thought you didn't like western food .  No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week .  That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food .  Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one .  That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . What can I do for you today ?  I need to return a book .  Can I do anything else for you ?  I want to check these books out .  Is that all ?  That ’ s all .  May I see your library card , please ?  It ’ s right here .  Will that be all for today ?  Yes . That ’ s it .  These are due back in two weeks .  All right . Have a good night . Which sports are popular in your country ?  Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball .  Do many people like tennis ?  More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit .  In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them .  Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf .  I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played .  A great deal of people follow rugby in my country .  There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player .  Oh , you're welcome . You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ?  Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other .  Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ?  No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . I've come to say goodbye .  When do you leave ?  I'm catching the eleven o'clock train .  Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch .  Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . The weather is terrible .  Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now .  I'm wearing my heavy jacket .  I'm going to put on more clothes , too .  Will it snow today ?  I don't know . Do you like snowing ?  Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful .  You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not .  Good idea . This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it .  I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country .  Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry .  No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it .  It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach .  Is it just a bus ?  Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need .  Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . Who's your favorite film star ?  Tom Hanks is always my favorite film star .  What films feature him ?  Many ! My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ?  Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year .  What happens on the holiday ?  Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year .  Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday ?  Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food . Rachel has decided to quit smoking .  Really ? Why ?  You never guess she is going to have a baby .  Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker .  Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby .  Oh , she is going to be a great mother . Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old McDonald .  Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ?  He ’ s nearly 90 .  Good gracious ! Are you sure ?  I am . What ’ s more , his wife is 84 .  Is she really ?  Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband .  Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year !  I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals .  Do you have a New Year's resolution ?  I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice .  Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work .  That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square .  Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight !  Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ?  Yes , I am.You must be Tom.Nice to meet you .  Nice to meet you too.Let me help you with your bags .  Be careful , Tom.Those are pretty heavy .  Wow , you're not kidding.Hold on a second.Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? Are you working or are you a student ?  I'm a student .  Which school are you studying at ?  Tsinghua University . I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it .  Have you any definite idea ?  Not yet , what's your opinion ?  I think you'd better try an active job . Mike ! What's going on , man ! Long time no see !  Hey , Pat ! Yeah , I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! How is going ?  Things doing great ! It ’ s funny running into you like this . Smell well , just last week I ran into Matt as well .  Yeah ? How ’ s he doing ?  He ’ s doing well . We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened .  Oh yeah ?  Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ...  Ha ha , really ?  Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious ! Hey , Jack , where's your car ?  I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one .  Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ?  Jump in , I'll give you a ride .  Ok . Boy , this looks expensive .  Yeah , it costed a bundle alright .  Wow , this's sinking a hole .  Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned .  I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .  We are on the high way . I'm the * * .  Wow , this car can really burn rubber .  It's a great feeling .  You made a perfect choice , Jack .  Thanks , Daisy . What's your email address ?  It's bulldog 123 .  Bulldog 123 . Are you sure that's all ?  Yes .  No . That's incomplete .  What do you mean ?  What's your mailing address ?  456 Cherry Drive , Pasadena , CA 91170 .  That's correct .  So what's the problem ?  Bulldog 123 is just the street . You have to give me the city , state , and ZIP code .  Oh , I get it . My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com . I'm here for my appointment .  What can I do for you today ?  I have an issue with my schedule .  Tell me the problem .  I have two classes on here that are at the same time .  Oh , I see .  Can you change that for me ?  Do you still want both classes ?  Yes , I would like to keep both classes .  I'll try to change one to a different day .  I would greatly appreciate that . I ’ d love to have my own farm .  It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?  I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy .  Running a farm would be totally different to you current job .  That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office .  You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into .  My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .  Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ?  no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ?  what about a factory tour ?  you mean visit a factory ?  yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .  good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?  I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour .  really ? What do the companies do that for ?  I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .  oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .  exactly .  do we need an appointment beforehand ?  I'll call the tourist information centre to check . Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty .  How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same .  The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now .  Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ?  Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes .  I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ?  Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you .  If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow .  It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible .  Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading .  It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees .  But we need the wood .  But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood . What are you guys doing ?  Just having a chat . What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ?  What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job .  Then , buy a bottle of soft drink .  Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ?  It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now .  Ok , I will go there myself .  Sorry , Mr . Polly .  It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ?  Have a try . I'm bored and got nothing to do tonight .  How about coming with me to meet my American friends ?  Hey , that sounds great .  Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock . What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ?  I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before .  Do you usually shower or take a bath ?  I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up .  Do you shave every morning ?  I shave every workday , but I only shave at weekends if I ’ m going out somewhere . If I ’ m staying at home , I don ’ t shave .  Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ?  Yes . I brush my teeth in the morning , just before I go to work . It ’ s actually the last thing I do before leaving . Then I brush again before bed .  Your dentist must be proud of you ! Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ?  No , not at all.Go ahead .  Are you married ?  Yes.Is that so important ?  Frankly yes.We like to employ married people.By the way , do you have any children ?  Yes , I have a three-year-old son . I'm not satisfied with it .  Why not ? What's wrong with it ?  Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either .  Would you like another one ?  No . Can I have my money back ?  Hmm ... have you got a receipt ?  A receipt ?  Yes . I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt .  Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it . Morning , Tom .  Hi , Mary .  You seem to be in a hurry .  Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute .  Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then .  Right . I ’ ll see you later .  See you later . Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ?  To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single .  Do you mean you got a divorce ?  Yes , my first marriage was a failure . Let me clear away the broken glass .  No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please .  It's very careless of me to have broken your glass .  Never mind . Have you followed the value of dollar lately ?  How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it .  It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke .  Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate .  What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in .  What about the Yen ?  Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan .  Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin .  Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .  While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries .  That is a really interesting fact .  I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach .  Just do whatever you feel like doing .  ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree .  Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade .  I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . What time is it , Tom ?  Just a minute . It ’ s ten to nine by my watch .  Is it ? I have no idea if I ’ m so late . I must be off now .  What ’ s the hurry ?  I must catch the nine-thirty Train .  It ’ s plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won ’ t take your twenty minutes to get there . Did you bring some lunch with you ?  Yes , I packed it myself .  Wow , that looks beautiful .  It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty .  I might try it myself . Can you name some festivals of religious nature ?  Yes , such as Christmas and Easter .  What about historic festivals ?  Thanksgiving Day , Independence Day . I wonder how Sarah and Mat are .  Don't you know they've already broken up ?  I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane .  And he's so handsome . Where's Bob ?  It seems like he's not coming .  Can you give him a call on his mobile ?  Sure . excuse me ; is this seat taken ?  no . It's all yours .  thank you very much . My name is Ashlan . It's nice to meet you .  Carson . It's nice to mee you , too .  the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ?  it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming .  global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere .  so sure . Are you from around here ?  no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago .  where are you from ?  I'm from China . What about you ?  I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago .  did you enjoy it ?  I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ?  it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it .  Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ?  yes , have you read it ?  no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ?  well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting .  well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you .  likewise . Bye ! Would you like a cup of coffee ?  Yes . That would be good .  Oh , no .  What's the matter ?  This machine is out of order .  You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ?  I sure did .  You ought to complain . These machine are always out of order . Hello , Mary . Nice day , isn't it ?  Yes , what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end .  I do feel like an outdoor exercise . After all , we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time .  How about taking a walk in the park ?  OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .  ( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me .  Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right .  Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people .  Ah , you changed so fast . How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ?  Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had .  Why ? What happened ?  Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .  What about the party ?  It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time .  So how long did you stay ?  I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there . Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ?  Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip .  I guess I need all of them .  Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .  I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .  Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ?  Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures .  I feel they all talk and behave in a different way .  They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys .  Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ?  She is certainly not my kind of girl .  Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes .  You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either .  I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' This one looks great ! I love the seashore .  So do I . The sun ... the sand ... the ocean !  And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ?  Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things .  Yeah ... me , too .  Well , except fishing . To be honest , I hate fishing , but I love all the others .  Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach .  You know . I really don't those big hotels .  Neither do I . Let's stay in a cabin.It ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean . May , look , what's that in the cage ?  Don't you know that ? It's panda .  Of course I know . I just can't see it very well .  OK , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ?  Of course , Bamboo !  That's right .  I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship .  You sound quite knowledgeable .  Not really , panda is my favorite animal .  Actually , it likes milk too .  Any way , in a word , panda is our friend .  Do you know other famous animals in the world ?  Yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous .  That's right . OK , let's move on . You look fresh recently.How do you make it ?  I attend an aerobic class three times a week .  Aren't you tired ?  No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . John , did you have a dream when you was a little boy ?  Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ’ t realize it .  I had the same experience with you . When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist . But now you see , I'm just a common office clerk .  Okay , forget about that . S , do you have some practical dreams at present ?  I do . And now I'm working hard to learn English , and I want to be an interpreter some day .  You're promising . Just follow your dream and never give up .  Thanks , I will . Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ?  Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up .  You are kidding , but she's so helpful .  Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you .  Come on . She's like that with everyone .  I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . Eric , how long will you be in China ?  I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while .  Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ?  Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out .  Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy .  You hit the nail right on the head .  Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ?  What is it ?  It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English .  Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ?  How about this sunday ?  Ok , cool .  Good . I'll give you a call tonight .  No problem .  Bye .
