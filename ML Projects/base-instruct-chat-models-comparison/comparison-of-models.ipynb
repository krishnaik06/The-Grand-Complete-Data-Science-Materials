Joining in the global project, DEAW: An integrated approach to the learning of reading, writing and speaking, Alexandra Gardens introduces weekly physical activity workshops, blending literacy and movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Created by staff of the multidisciplinary arts organisation, Roar Contemporary, beginning a March residency at Alexandra Gardens, the project is open to any year one and two class in any school. Set up as a mini-writing festival, DEAW is designed to be a fun way of realising the joy of imaginative storytelling, where 'each morning children arrive at the studio, each with a pencil, each bursting with imagination, ideas and a sense of fun,' says the Alexandra Gardens team. 'We soon see the ties that bind, the girls grab into their imagination world while the boys instinctively move deeper into a world of adventure!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Noting that this 'creates an emotional charge we work with', the Alexandra Gardens school community views this opportunity as 'excellent for making the connections in the brain from our emotional world to our physical world, ' new pathways almost immediately emerge into what might be a story', believes classroom teacher, Kate Smith, who sees an improvement across every genre in the students' work. Students organise and plan writing ahead of time within vocabulary walls, and come with detailed dialogue and sketches of characters, taking control of their learning, using resources provided by staff. 'This is an exciting and inspiring time for the children,' says Kate. 'They'll be developing their writing and communication skills with Roar contemporary – workshops are engaging, dynamic, and playful, and all surrounded by quality art in which the children have genuine freedom of expressive choice.'\n",

Every day, as she walked along the shore, she would collect seashells, chase seagulls, and dream of the unknown wonders that lay beyond the horizon.\n",

      "One particularly bright morning, while skipping stones across the water, Lily noticed a glimmering object wedged between the rocks. Curiosity sparked in her eyes, she waded into the crystal-clear sea and carefully retrieved the object. It was an ancient-looking scroll, sealed with a wax emblem of a seahorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intrigued, Lily rushed home with the scroll and shared her discovery with her grandmother, Beatrice. Wise and knowledgeable about tales of old, Beatrice recognized the emblem as the mark of the Mystic Tides, a legendary group of sea creatures believed to have powers to protect the ocean's harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "With enthusiasm and a sense of wonder, Lily and Beatrice embarked on a quest to decipher the contents of the scroll. They discovered it was a treasure map, pointing to a fabled island said to be inhabited by the Mystic Tides themselves. The island seemed to hold the key to harmonizing the delicate balance disrupted by human actions on the oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Determined to restore the ocean's balance, Lily and Beatrice set sail across the vast blue sea. As they approached the mystical island, they encountered playful dolphins leaping alongside their boat, leading the way. The dolphins seemed to sense their purpose and guided the duo safely through treacherous waves and hidden reefs.\n",
      "\n",

      "We have seen that MPD’s prime formula language allows definitions in which a predicate indicates a collection of objects. Such a collection is called a relation. A relation is often expressed by a collection of ordered pairs in which the object placed on the left is related to the object placed on the right by some property. The corresponding matrix of the relation represents the positions held by such pairs. Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "pairList A B X Y . . . = {(A, B), (A, X), (B, Y), ... }\n",
      "\n",
      "The positions of the pairs A-B, A-X, ..., can be represented by a three10 rows by three columns matrix10 with elements zero or one0 representing absence or presence of the pair, respectively. Similarly the matrix {B, A, Y} could be represented by a matrix of dimension five by three or thirty rows and columns. The major difference would be the number zero or one and the eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matrix and vector representations of relations can be defined in the flex3 part of a prime formula. Rate the relationship by the matrix multiplication of the concatenation of the two vectors using the dot3 product of vectors, having the dimensions of the arguments, . Raise the dimension of the argument matrices. Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "rel.Obj multiplyVec. U rel.X rel.Y = {(x, i) for x in a . x, for i in j} /\\ {(x, i) for x in b . x, for i in j}\n",
      "\n",
      "The new vector U represents the relations between the objects. The dimension, size, or length of the vectors should be as large as is needed for finding a relation. The reduction of the relation vectorized is not sufficient. By having a large vector the possibility of having a positively related pair of objects will be more or less certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following example will make this clearer. We have two sets of objects: humans living in the middle ages and their long misery. They are either given (G) relief (R) by their lords (L), meaning for instance better clothing and food and a reduction of the inhabitant tax, or they are “absolutely” not (N) having a life with loads of miseries.\n",
